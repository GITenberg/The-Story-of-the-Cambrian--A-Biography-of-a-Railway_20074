v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Credit for the inspiration of this book belongs to my friend, Mr. W. R.
Hall, of Aberystwyth, who, in one of his interesting series of
&ldquo;Reminiscences&rdquo; of half a century of Welsh journalism,
contributed to the &ldquo;Cambrian News,&rdquo; recently expressed his
surprise that no one had hitherto attempted to write the history of the
Cambrian Railways.&nbsp; With the termination of that Company&rsquo;s
separate existence, on its amalgamation with the Great Western Railway
under the Government&rsquo;s grouping scheme, &ldquo;the hour&rdquo; for
such an effort seems to have struck; and Mr. Hall&rsquo;s pointed
indication of Oswestry as the most appropriate place where the work could
be undertaken, not only by reason of its close connection with the official
headquarters of the Cambrian, but because, in a certain newspaper office
there lay the files containing so many old records of the railway&rsquo;s
birth and early struggles for existence, even the selection of &ldquo;the
man&rdquo; appeared so severely circumscribed that to the present writer it
virtually amounted to what, in certain ecclesiastical circles, is termed
&ldquo;a call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Responsibility for its acceptance, however, and for the execution of the
task, with its manifold imperfections and shortcomings, rests entirely with
the author, whose only qualification for assuming the r&ocirc;le of
biographer of the Cambrian is the deep interest he has always taken in a
subject worthy of a far abler pen.&nbsp; Not even the attempt would have
been possible <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>had it not been for the valuable assistance readily given by many
kind friends directly or indirectly associated with the Cambrian
Railways.</p>
<p>Special thanks are due, and hereby gratefully acknowledged, to Mr.
Samuel Williamson General Manager, not for only much personal trouble taken
in supplying information and looking through proof-sheets, but for placing
no small portion of the time of some members of his clerical staff at the
disposal of the author, who has troubled them on many occasions, but never
without receiving prompt and patient response; to other officials and
employees, past and present, of the Company for information regarding their
several departments, and their personal recollections, including Mr. T. S.
Goldsworthy, the senior officer and sole surviving member of the &ldquo;old
guard,&rdquo; who played their part in the battles of the Parliamentary
Committee-rooms of long ago, whose reminiscences of the days of old have
proved particularly useful; to the Earl of Powis for permission to inspect
the voluminous papers of the late Earl, whose name was so intimately
associated with the early development of railway schemes in
Montgomeryshire; to the family of the late Mr. David Howell for similar
facilities in regard to his papers; and, for the loan of photographs or
assistance of varied sort to Colonel Apperley, Mr. E. D. Nicholson, Park
Issa, Oswestry, Mr. W. P. Rowlands and Mr. Edmund Gillart, Machynlleth, Mr.
Robert Owen, Broad Street, Welshpool, Mr. J. Harold Thomas, Garth Derwen,
Buttington, the Misses Ward, Whittington, Miss Mickleburgh, Oswestry, Mr.
E. Shone, Oswestry, the Editor of the &ldquo;Peterborough
Advertiser,&rdquo; the publishers of the &ldquo;Great Western
Magazine,&rdquo; and others.</p>
<p>The indexing has been compiled by Mr. Kay, Public Librarian, Oswestry,
to whom thanks are due for the efficient discharge of a rather irksome
duty.</p>
<p><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>As to the arrangement of the book itself: in tracing the various
stages of construction, often simultaneous or overlapping in point of time,
of the several separate and formerly independent undertakings into which
the Cambrian system was subsequently consolidated, and still further
augmented by later local amalgamations, it has been found well-nigh
impossible, chronologically, to maintain at once a clear and consecutive
story.&nbsp; Recourse has, therefore, been had to the method of dealing
with each section of the line in separate chapters, and the same plan
applies to some departments of development in later years.&nbsp; But an
endeavour has been made to follow, as comprehensively as such circumstances
permit, the general course of the Railway&rsquo;s growth; and it is in the
hope that, however imperfectly, it may serve to recal seventy years of
struggle, triumph and romance in Welsh railway annals that to Lt.-Col.
David Davies, M.P., its last Chairman, and Mr. Samuel Williamson, its last
General Manager, and his numerous other friends among the officers and
staff of all ranks, the writer begs to dedicate this little story of the
Cambrian, in memory of many happy days spent in travelling, as a privileged
passenger, along its far-reaching lines.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p>When what eventually became the Cambrian Railways was born it was a very
tiny baby.&nbsp; Compared with its ultimate frame, it possessed neither
arms nor legs, nor even head, and consisted merely of heart and a small
part of its trunk.&nbsp; It began &ldquo;in the air&rdquo; at Newtown and
ended, if possible, in still more ethereal poise, at Llanidloes.&nbsp;
Physical junction with existing lines there was none, and the
engines&mdash;four in number&mdash;which drew the coaches that composed
those early trains had to be brought by road, from Oswestry, in specially
constructed wagons, not without difficulties and adventures, and placed on
the metals at the railhead, to live their life and perform their duty in
&ldquo;splendid isolation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was only gradually that limb
after limb was added, and subsequently constructed railways were
incorporated or absorbed, until the consolidated system obtained the rather
attenuated proportions with which we are familiar to-day, stretching from
Whitchurch, on the Cheshire border, to Aberystwyth, on the shores of
Cardigan Bay, with its two chief <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>subsidiary &ldquo;sections,&rdquo; one
(including some half dozen miles of the original track) from Moat Lane
Junction to Brecon, and another from Dovey Junction to Pwllheli; shorter
branches or connecting lines from Ellesmere to Wrexham, Oswestry to
Llangynog, Llanymynech to Llanfyllin, Abermule to Kerry, Cemmes Road to
Dinas Mawddwy, Barmouth Junction to Dolgelley, and two lengths of narrow
gauge line, from Welshpool to Llanfair Caereinion and Aberystwyth to
Devil&rsquo;s Bridge, altogether exactly 300 miles.</p>
<p>Such, in briefest outline, denotes how &ldquo;the Cambrian&rdquo; began
and what it has grown to be; but there is little virtue in a mere recital
of statistics, and the writing of &ldquo;history,&rdquo; of the kind once
defined by the late Lord Halsbury as &ldquo;only a string of names and
dates&rdquo; would be no congenial task to the present author.&nbsp; Nor,
happily, is it necessary to confine oneself to such barren and unemotional
limits.&nbsp; It is not in the record of train miles run, of the number of
passengers and the weight of the merchandise carried, or even in the
dividends earned, or not earned (though these factors are not without their
value to the proprietors) that the chief interest in the story of a railway
lies. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; Very often it is the tale of unending trial
and difficulty and even apparent failure which holds for the spectator the
largest measure of romance, and such is certainly the case of what, at one
time, was, with quite as much sympathetic affection as contempt, popularly
called &ldquo;the poor old Cambrian.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were times when the
difficulties which faced its constructors appeared to be absolutely
insuperable.&nbsp; What with the enormous weight of <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>its cradle, measured in
gold, and the continual quarrels of its nurses, the undertaking was well
nigh strangled at birth.&nbsp; Even when the line was actually opened for
traffic a burden of financial difficulty rested upon Directors and Managers
that might have crushed the spirit out of many a stout heart.</p>
<p>Judged by the maturer experience of long years, it is wonderful to think
that, even under the most careful management, the Company should have been
able to survive its constant buffetings at the hand of Fate, but survive it
has, and by eternal patience and unfailing perseverance these many troubles
were at length overcome, and if to-day the railway offers facilities and
comforts to the travelling public that stand the test of comparison with
such as are provided by the great trunk lines of England and Scotland, it
is no small tribute to those who have worked long and labouring to bring
its services to their present high standard of efficiency.</p>
<p>But of the Cambrian as we know it to-day there will be something more to
be said presently.&nbsp; Biography, by time-honoured custom, if not
necessity, begins with birth and parentage; and, though corporate bodies
may often experience some difficulty about laying claim to a &ldquo;lang
pedigree,&rdquo; even a railway company cannot come into existence without
considerable pre-natal labour.</p>
<p>Among its parents the Cambrian possessed some men of rare grit and
determination.&nbsp; Prominent among them was one who ranks high among the
makers of modern Wales, whose name has become a household word not only in
his native land, but wherever Welshmen congregate throughout the world, and
is still, by happy coincidence, intimately associated, in the third
generation, with the Cambrian to-day.&nbsp; The story of David Davies of
Llandinam <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>has been fully told in other pages, <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a> but it is so closely woven
around the romance of the railway which he did so much to bring into being
that no record of that undertaking would be complete without some reference
to it, however brief.&nbsp; Born at a small holding called Draintewion,
perched on the hillside overlooking the Severn Vale near Llandinam, the
eldest of a family of nine children, on December 18,
1818,&mdash;&ldquo;three eighteens,&rdquo; as he used in later life
jocularly to remark&mdash;his boyhood was spent on the little plot of land
tilling its rich soil, or helping his father, in the work of sawing timber
into planks, a commodity for which public demand was then rapidly
increasing.&nbsp; His only schooling was received in a little seminary
carried on in the village church, and that wonderful educational
institution of rural Wales, the Sunday School.&nbsp; But at the age of
eleven the desk was deserted for the saw bench, and the rest of his
instruction was derived at &ldquo;the University of Observation, in which
he took not a mere &lsquo;pass&rsquo; but very high
&lsquo;honours&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; A keen observation of human nature, a
shrewd judgment of men and beast, and a ready aptitude for application of
native wit to the problems of life developed David Davies into the man of
wealth and power he ultimately became.&nbsp; Even in his school <!-- page
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>days, however,
these latent traits were not unobservable.&nbsp; It is recorded that
&ldquo;he was the winner of every game.&rdquo;&nbsp; He may have had a
generous portion of what men call &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; but to it was added
the still more valuable element of industry and perseverance and healthy
ambition.&nbsp; He knew how to take the chances which came his way, which
is probably the secret of success with many who &ldquo;get on.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When opportunity offered to enter a new path he readily seized it, and from
the hewer of wood he became the modest contractor, and ultimately the
greater builder of bridges, docks and railways.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Passengers travelling along the Cambrian line from Moat Lane Junction to
Llanidloes, may notice, at Llandinam, the roadway which runs below the
church, and crosses the river on an embankment to the station.&nbsp; The
construction of that highway was the first contract which David Davies
held, and it stands to-day, hard by the statue of him which has since been
erected, as a monument of his self-reliant zeal and sound
workmanship.&nbsp; Other contracts followed, including that for the
construction of Oswestry Smithfield, and it was during one of his visits to
that town that Mr. Davies formed a friendship which led to a partnership
that, in its turn, played a potent part in the making of the Cambrian.</p>
<p>For in Oswestry there lived Mr. Thomas Savin, who had been born, in
1826, at Llwynymaen, and was a partner in a mercer&rsquo;s business with
Mr. Edward Morris (who afterwards purchased and sold the Van Mine near
Caersws), under the style of Messrs. Morris and Savin.&nbsp; Mr.
Savin&rsquo;s mind, however, was not entirely concentrated on measuring
cloth and calico.&nbsp; He took a keen interest in the life of the town,
and was an energetic supporter of local institutions.&nbsp; Elected to the
Town Council in 1856, he was <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>mayor in 1863, and appointed alderman in 1871,
an office he retained to the end of his varied life.&nbsp; But these
honours had yet to come.&nbsp; Already, at the time of which we are now
writing, Mr. Savin had visions of a larger enterprise beyond the boundaries
of his native borough.</p>
<p>Like many large and generous-hearted men, Mr. Savin was very impetuous
and impatient of delays.&nbsp; On one occasion, it is related, when still a
mercer at Oswestry, he drove over to a Welsh border market town to sell his
wares.&nbsp; It was the custom there for farmers to decline to look at any
other business till the sale of the live stock was disposed of, and the
market being loth to start and Mr. Savin eager to be home again, he rushed
into the arena and startled the company present by buying a thousand
sheep.&nbsp; This was before he became associated with railway pioneering,
but it is a characteristic example of that dramatic impulsiveness which led
to his subsequent success&mdash;and failure.</p>
<p>Caught by the spirit of venture and enthusiasm, which had swept over the
country after the successful opening of the Manchester and Liverpool
Railway in 1830, his thoughts had begun to turn to railway production, and
the meeting with the young Montgomeryshire road and bridge builder opened
the looked for door.&nbsp; In a room over the tobacconist shop now occupied
by Mr. Richards, opposite the Post Office, in Church Street, Oswestry, and
close to the premises in which, some fifteen or sixteen years earlier
another notable man, Shirley Brooks, afterwards editor of
&ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; had toiled as a lawyer&rsquo;s article pupil to his
uncle, Mr. Charles Sabine, Mr. Davies and Mr. Savin were brought together
by Mr. George Owen, himself destined to play no small part in the planning
of the Cambrian.&nbsp; A man of Kent, native of Tunbridge Wells, Mr. Owen
had begun his business career <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in the office of Mr. Charles Mickleburgh, land
surveyor, agent and enclosure commissioner, of Montgomery, one of whose
daughters he subsequently married.&nbsp; He worked side by side with
another young engineer, of whom we shall hear more presently,&mdash;Mr.
Benjamin Piercy, under whose initial leadership, Mr. Owen, as resident
engineer, was to serve the local railway for many a long year.&nbsp; Nor
was that the only capacity in which his gifts were displayed.&nbsp; Making
Oswestry his home, he became a member of the Town Council in 1860, mayor in
1864 and 1865, and alderman in 1874.&nbsp; For twenty years he was a member
of the General Purposes Committee, served as borough and county magistrate,
and was a member of the School Board from its inception, and chairman from
1891 till his death in 1901.&nbsp; Indeed, there was no interest in the
town,&mdash;administrative, commercial and recreative,&mdash;in which he
did not fill a conspicuous role.&nbsp; But, perhaps, of all his services to
the community, none was more opportune or more prolific of far-reaching
results than that happy inspiration of introducing Messrs. Davies and
Savin.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>Still, it takes more than a couple of contractors, however enthusiastic,
to construct a railway.&nbsp; Though the more visible, the organiser of the
labour is not the only parent.&nbsp; Not less essential, in his creative
function, is the capitalist; and even the powerful combination of
capitalist and contractor is insufficient to carry matters to a practical
conclusion without the expert guidance of the engineer.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
Messrs. Davies and Savin, as the new partnership was termed, had not long
to wait before their opportunity arrived.</p>
<p>The great &ldquo;railway mania&rdquo; which reached its climax on that
notable Sunday, November 30th, 1845, to be followed by <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the catastrophic bursting
of the bubble, had left men rather sobered in their outlook upon the future
possibilities of speculation in this alluring direction.&nbsp; It had
witnessed the formulation of no fewer than 1,263 separate railway schemes,
involving an (hypothetical) expenditure of 560 millions sterling, of which
643 got no further than the issue of a prospectus, while over 500 went
through all the necessary stages of being brought before Parliament and 272
actually became Acts&mdash;&ldquo;to the ruin of thousands who had
afterwards to find the money to fulfil the engagements into which they had
so rashly entered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst these was a Bill for converting the Montgomeryshire Canal into a
railway line, for which an Act was passed in 1846, but it was a
hare-brained scheme and soon came to nought.&nbsp; Other proposals,
however, developed into what promised, and have since proved, to be highly
profitable enterprises.&nbsp; The western Midlands and North Wales had been
linked by the line from Shrewsbury to Chester, which Mr. Henry Robertson,
M.P., for the former town and afterwards for the County of Merioneth, in
which his residence, Pal&eacute;, near Corwen, was situate, had carried
over the great viaducts of Chirk and Cefn.&nbsp; From Chester, Mr. Robert
Stephenson, even more daring, had flung his extension of the North Western
system, by way of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The magic Bridge of Bangor<br />
Hung awful in the sky.&rdquo; <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>across the Menai Straits into Anglesey and so to Holyhead.&nbsp; The air
was again thick, and to become thicker, with new <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>adventures.&nbsp; Hardly
a valley in North or Central Wales but had its ardent advocates of
connecting lines.&nbsp; Within a short time newspaper columns were to be
flooded with prospectuses of all sorts of schemes.&nbsp; Parliamentary
committee rooms buzzed with forensic eloquence about the advantages and
disadvantages of this or that route.&nbsp; Expert witnesses swore this,
that, or anything else, as expert witnesses generally will, provided, that
like the gentlemen who question and cross-question them, they are
sufficiently briefed.&nbsp; In vain did the secluded Lake Poet protest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no nook of English ground secure<br />
From rash assault?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iron road was to come, and come it did, all conquering and, not so
unbeneficial, after all, in its rule.</p>
<p>Amidst this welter of proposals and counter-proposals there emerged,
sometime during 1852 a scheme, propounded by Mr. Bethell, of Westminster
for constructing a railway connecting the existing line at Shrewsbury with
Aberystwyth.&nbsp; It was to run by way of the Rea Valley, through
Minsterley, and to strike the Severn Valley again in the neighbourhood of
Montgomery, whence it was to continue through Newtown and Llanidloes.&nbsp;
This was quickly followed by another for a line from Oswestry to Newtown,
which was projected under Shrewsbury and Chester Railway auspices.&nbsp; To
the latter Mr. Bethell replied by transferring his scheme to the North
Western Company, whose engineers remodelled it.&nbsp; With a view to
driving any rival Montgomeryshire scheme out of the field, the proposed new
line was diverted from the Rea Valley to pass by way of Criggion and
Welshpool to Newtown, with a branch from Criggion to Oswestry, and between
Newtown and Aberystwyth it was altered to go by Machynlleth, instead of
Llanidloes.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>This sort of strategy, however, only seemed to stimulate the men
of Montgomeryshire to fresh determination to show their independence, and
in this they had the adventitious aid of a very influential neighbour, Mr.
George Hammond Whalley.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page10b.jpg">
<img alt="The late MR. G. H. WHALLEY, M.P., from a Portrait presented by
the citizens of Peterborough, and now hanging in Peterborough Museum"
src="images/page10s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Mr. Whalley was a very remarkable man.&nbsp; A native of Gloucester,
according to &ldquo;Debrett,&rdquo; he was a lineal descendant of Edward
Whalley (first cousin to Oliver Cromwell and John Hampden), who signed the
warrant for the execution of Charles I.&nbsp; At the University College,
London, he carried off first prize in rhetoric and logic, afterwards was
called to the bar, for some years went the Oxford Circuit and acted as
Assistant Tithe Commissioner, and Examiner of Private Bills for
Parliament.&nbsp; He lived at Plas Madoc, Ruabon, was a deputy lieutenant
for Denbighshire and a magistrate for that county, Montgomeryshire and
Merionethshire.&nbsp; In 1853 he acted as High Sheriff of Carnarvonshire,
and at the time of the Crimean War he volunteered the services of the troop
of Denbighshire Yeomanry Cavalry of which he was Captain and received the
thanks of the War Office.&nbsp; Some years earlier, during the Irish
famine, he established fisheries on the west coast of Ireland, and, in his
own yacht, explored and ascertained the position of the fishing
banks.&nbsp; The electors of Leominster declined to return him to
Parliament in 1845, as did also the Montgomery Boroughs in 1852; but later
that year he was elected for Peterborough, unseated on petition, re-elected
the next year and again unseated.&nbsp; He unsuccessfully contested the
same constituency in 1857, but was elected in May 1859 and sat till his
death in 1878, during his Parliamentary career devoting a good deal of
attention to the reform of private bill procedure on which he carried a not
unimportant measure.&nbsp; But he was no mere meticulous lawyer.&nbsp; His
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>frantic espousal of the Protestant cause, supposed by the timid in
the middle of last century to be in some danger in England, earned him a
good deal of notoriety and a popular name.&nbsp; Hardly more eccentric was
the warm support he gave to the cause of Arthur Orton in his claim to the
title and estate of Sir Roger Tichborne.&nbsp; On one of the last visits he
paid to Oswestry he called to see a friend.&nbsp; As he was leaving his
friend&rsquo;s office he suddenly turned round and asked &ldquo;Do you
believe in the Claimant?&rdquo;&nbsp; The reply was an emphatic
negative.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed the departing visitor,
&ldquo;you will come to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Mr. Whalley was a bad prophet in this respect, his instinct did
not always mislead him.&nbsp; He believed in himself, which was not only a
more substantial faith, but more to the point in this narrative, for it
enabled him, by dint of self-assurance, largely to dominate, and
occasionally to domineer, the railway world of Montgomeryshire and the
adjacent counties and to contribute in no small measure to the successful
accomplishment of several local schemes.</p>
<p>Conspicuous among them was the Llanidloes and Newtown.&nbsp; Though an
isolated link in itself, it was intended to form part of a chain that was
to stretch from Manchester and the industrial north to Milford Haven, a
famous Welsh seaport, and this dream was constantly in the mind of local
promoters whenever and wherever such sectional schemes were
discussed.&nbsp; On October 30th, 1852, a meeting was held at Llanidloes,
with Mr. Whalley in the chair, at which the project was cordially adopted,
a committee formed to further its achievement by raising the necessary
subscriptions, and arrangements made for carrying the fiery cross of
propaganda to Newtown and Rhayader, and as far afield as Aberystwyth.&nbsp;
On this effective errand Mr. Whalley and his coadjutors stumped the <!--
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>countryside, and &ldquo;inn bills&rdquo; began to form no
inconsiderable item in the promoters&rsquo; balance sheets.&nbsp; But
nothing can be accomplished in this world without effort and expenditure;
and to the missionaries&rsquo; warning words against &ldquo;the evil of
conceding to an overbearing leviathan neighbour any privileges calculated
to endanger the independence of their little company,&rdquo; we are
informed by a chronicler of the day, &ldquo;the county nobly responded, and
petitions were sent from every district, praying for the recognition by
Parliament of the principles so ably enunciated by Mr. Whalley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;little company&rdquo; had, indeed, good reason to be
apprehensive; but fortune favoured its course.&nbsp; Before this onslaught,
even the &ldquo;overbearing leviathan&rdquo; quailed.&nbsp; After long and
costly struggle in the Parliamentary committee rooms, accommodation was
reached, and in the House of Commons the Montgomeryshire promoters&rsquo;
scheme passed with flying colours; but an unfortunate error, by which the
levels were proved to be some 18 feet below the Severn water, wrecked it in
the Lords.&nbsp; In August, 1853, however, the scheme received
Parliamentary sanction, and out of the long list of &ldquo;provisional
directors&rdquo; appointed the previous year, the first board was
formed.&nbsp; They were:&mdash;Mr. Whalley, chairman; Mr. W. Lefeaux,
vice-chairman; Alderman E. Cleaton, Llanidloes; Alderman Richard Holmes,
Llanidloes; Mr. Wm. Lloyd, Newtown; Mr. Edward Morris, Oxon, Shrewsbury;
Mr. T. E. Marsh, Llanidloes, and Mr. T. Prickard, Dderw, Radnorshire.&nbsp;
Mr. Rice Hopkins was the engineer, Mr. T. P. Prichard, general manager, and
Mr. John Jenkins, secretary.&nbsp; Mr. Jenkins, however, soon transferred
his services to the office of auditor, and was succeeded by Mr. Thomas
Hayward.</p>
<h3><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>III.</h3>
<p>And so, with eager hearts, directors looked forward to a rosy
future.&nbsp; It is interesting to recall what, in their opinion, the
financial prospects of the line were.&nbsp; Larger schemes loomed in
ambitious minds, but, even confined to the local line along the Severn
valley, the estimated revenue was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Passengers &pound;2,350</p>
<p>Coal &pound;750</p>
<p>Lead, Copper, and Barytes Ore &pound;1,700</p>
<p>Timber (chiefly used in working the mines) &pound;900</p>
<p>Iron, Powder, and other articles used by miners &pound;75</p>
<p>Lime for Agricultural and other purposes &pound;900</p>
<p>Corn, Flour, and other Agricultural Produce &pound;600</p>
<p>Cattle, Sheep, and other animals &pound;300</p>
<p>Wool and Woollen Manufactures &pound;225</p>
<p>General Merchandise and Shop Goods &pound;250</p>
<p>Building Stone, Tiles, Bricks, etc. &pound;200</p>
<p>Total &pound;8,250</p>
<p>Estimating working expenses at 50 per cent., that left a surplus of
&pound;4,125, being nearly 7 per cent. per annum on &pound;60,000, the
required capital.&nbsp; With such a scheme the majority of the local owners
readily expressed their agreement, and arrangements were made for cutting
of the first sod, in a field which was to form the site of the Llanidloes
station, on October 3rd, 1855.&nbsp; Mrs. Owen, of Glansevern, was invited
to perform the ceremony, but, owing to what she regarded as a premature
announcement of the fact in the &ldquo;Shrewsbury Chronicle,&rdquo; that
lady sent an advertisement to the journal announcing the postponement of
the function.&nbsp; Pages of the <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Company&rsquo;s minute book were devoted to
expressions of the Board&rsquo;s &ldquo;utmost astonishment&rdquo; and
demands for explanations.&nbsp; Mrs. Owen was at no loss for material to
furnish equally voluminous reply, the pith of which was that she was simply
inspired by a desire to obtain time, both to secure the attendance of her
influential friends and to inform herself of the financial position of the
undertaking.</p>
<p>It was all a storm in a tea-cup, but it was a very severe storm while it
lasted; and Mr. Whalley had to cut the sod himself, in a deluge of rain,
taking occasion, however, in doing so, to express, in graceful terms, the
disappointment felt at the absence of one &ldquo;who had done so much to
introduce improved means of communication through the county,&rdquo; a
reference equally gracefully acknowledged by letter from Glansevern a few
days later.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up to the present period,&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Owen,
&ldquo;we have been strangers in this part of the county to the
preparations necessary for inaugurating a railway, and it should not,
therefore, be wondered at if our first attempt should not have been
attended with <i>perfect success</i>; misapprehension, excess of zeal and
inexperience might all lead to mistakes and errors, and it is not, perhaps,
possible for us all to escape censure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps not.&nbsp; At any rate, it was a philosophic conclusion, and it
enabled the Board, with unruffled feathers, to proceed to the business of
receiving tenders for the construction of the line.&nbsp; Out of seven, the
lowest was that of Mr. David Davies, who was, moreover, prepared to accept
part payment in shares, an arrangement which, later, paved the way to the
process of leasing these local railways to the contractors, that became
almost a custom.&nbsp; Hardly, however, had these preliminaries been
successfully negotiated, when Mr. Rice Hopkins died, and after a temporary
agreement with one of his <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>relatives to carry on in an advisory capacity,
the Board proceeded to select a successor out of four &ldquo;persons who
presented themselves as eligible for this purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their choice was easily made.&nbsp; The line was being built by a local
contractor.&nbsp; Fate was now to throw up a new engineer, whose claims
were not less obvious on similar grounds.&nbsp; A native of Trefeglwys, Mr.
Benjamin Piercy had, from an early age, taken great interest in railway
planning, and, though this branch of the profession did not directly touch
his daily routine, he devoted many leisure hours to its study.&nbsp; In his
journeys through Wales he was impressed with the necessity of opening out
its valleys to the great railway world that was developing beyond the
English border, and when Mr. Henry Robertson began to make his surveys of
the Shrewsbury and Chester line, Mr. Piercy became one of his
assistants.&nbsp; So diligently did the young man discharge his duties here
that, it is recorded, he was the means of preventing the loss of a year in
obtaining the Act for the making of this line.</p>
<p>It was natural, therefore, that, when the Rea Valley line was being
mooted, he should be engaged to prepare the Parliamentary plans.&nbsp; It
was in this connection that an untoward incident occurred, which throws
some light on the tremendous rivalry that existed among the promoters of
various railway schemes and the means that were sometimes adopted to thwart
the progress of antagonistic proposals.&nbsp; Mr. Piercy had, with great
energy, got his plans ready and taken them to London, but they were
surreptitiously removed from his room at the hotel, and the matter was hung
up for a year.&nbsp; In the meantime, as we have already noted, the line of
route was changed.&nbsp; In the following year, however, he duly deposited
the plans for the railway from Shrewsbury to Welshpool, with a branch to
Minsterley, already mentioned.&nbsp; Although strongly <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>opposed, at every
stage, including Standing Orders, Mr. Piercy succeeded in carrying the Bill
through both Houses, and it received the Royal assent.&nbsp; It was in the
Select Committees on this Bill that he first made his reputation as a
witness in Parliamentary Committees.&nbsp; After this he was engaged upon
nearly all the projects for introducing independent railways into Wales,
all of them meeting with fierce opposition.&nbsp; For several days
consecutively he was as a witness under cross-examination by the genial Mr.
Serjeant Merewether, and other eminent counsel, but so little headway were
they able to make against Mr. Piercy that, upon one occasion, when a
Committee passed a Bill of his, Mr. Merewether held up his brief-bag and
asked the Committee whether they would not give that too to Mr. Piercy. <a

<p>In 1858 Mr. Piercy was formally appointed engineer to the Company.&nbsp;
With the assistance of Mr. George Owen, the cordial co-operation of Messrs.
Davies and Savin, and under the enthusiastic leadership of Mr. Whalley, he
was destined to carry these undertakings into being, and to nurture them in
their infancy, and thus to join the little group of pioneer workers who, in
their several capacities, may, in special degree, be termed the parents of
the Cambrian.</p>

17</span>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; A BIRTHDAY PARTY.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A birthday</i>:&mdash;<i>and now a day that rose<br />
</i>&nbsp;  <i>with much of hope, with meaning rife</i>&mdash;<br />
<i>A thoughtful day from dawn to close</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jean Ingleow</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the advent of the young Montgomeryshire engineer, and his cordial
co-operation with the Montgomeryshire contractor, the public began eagerly
to count the days, or at any rate, the months, before the due arrival of
the first Montgomeryshire railway.&nbsp; The prospects of a punctual
delivery were eminently propitious.&nbsp; In his first report, Mr. Piercy
was able to announce substantial progress with the work, which was being
carried out by Messrs. Davies and Savin, &ldquo;at a cost below that of any
railway yet brought into operation.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, there were one or
two inevitable set-backs.&nbsp; One of the engines which had arrived by
road, and been set on the rails at Newtown, refused properly to perform its
duty; but, fortunately, a Mr. Howell, of Hawarden, who knew all about the
intricate interior of these new-fangled monsters, happened to be staying at
Llanidloes, and he was called in to diagnose and advise, with effective
result.</p>
<p>A more serious problem was the revision of the terms of the lease of the
line to Messrs. Davies and Savin, which a committee of shareholders were
busily engaged in attempting to carry forward.&nbsp; Complications of
another sort led Mr. Piercy <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>to tender his resignation, which, being
somewhat peremptorily refused, he withdrew.&nbsp; Still further anxiety and
considerable expense was involved in the prosecution of Parliamentary
application for power to extend the line from the originally designed
terminus at Newtown to the Shropshire Union Canal; for, though it was only
a matter of some quarter of a mile, it was strenuously opposed in both
Houses.&nbsp; Such were the distractions which beset railway building in
those days; but enthusiasm and determination still triumphed, and the work
proceeded along the line with sufficient rapidity to admit its being opened
for mineral traffic on April 30th, 1859.&nbsp; At the very last moment
trouble was experienced in obtaining the necessary certificate of the Board
of Trade for passenger traffic, but that precious document came to hand on
August 9th, and, with more fortunate outcome than on a previous occasion,
Mrs. Owen, of Glansevern, was invited to perform the pleasing duty of
declaring the line open.</p>
<p>The day fixed was Wednesday, August 31st, and a local newspaper gives us
some account of the proceedings:&mdash;&ldquo;Preparations were made on an
extensive scale, and the day was ushered in by cannon firing, bell-ringing,
and the hearty congratulations of the people of the town, with their
country friends, who flocked in to take part in the proceedings.&nbsp; The
houses were elegantly decorated with flags and banners, flowers and
evergreens, and a variety of mottoes, more or less appropriate.&nbsp;
Amongst others we noticed, on the Old Market Hall (which, by the way, it
was a charity to hide from the gaze of strangers), a profusion of flags,
with a large banner in the centre, &lsquo;Hail, Star of
Brunswick.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Red Lion exhibited a local tribute to its
friend, by placing on the door &lsquo;Welcome, Whalley, champion of our
rights.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Railway Station was profusely decorated, and the
Queen&rsquo;s Head displayed an <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>elegant archway of leaves and flowers.&nbsp;
The Trewythen Arms was also gaily covered with flags, and numbers of
private houses displayed a variety of gay decorations.&nbsp; The cold and
wet state of the weather in no way damped the ardour of the men of
Montgomeryshire, and they were rewarded by a speedy dispersion of clouds,
and the grateful warmth of the noonday sun.&nbsp; Llanidloes was all alive;
business was entirely suspended and soon after 9 o&rsquo;clock a large
crowd collected near the public rooms, where a procession was formed,
headed by the Plasmadoc Brass Band, and accompanied in the following order
by:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Mayor (W. Swancott, Esq.), and the Corporation consisting of Messrs.
R. Homes, E. Clayton, T. Davies, T. F. Roberts, D. Snead; L. Minshall,
Pugh, J. Jarman, Hamer, J. Mendus Jones,</p>
<p>Flag.</p>
<p>Banner,&mdash;&lsquo;Whither Bound?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;To

<p>(With the inscription):</p>

<p>Mrs. Owen followed in a carriage.</p>
<p>Guests and Shareholders.</p>
<p>Ladies (two and two).</p>
<p>Gentlemen (two and two).</p>

Newtown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Excavators (with bannerets).</p>
<p>Flag,&mdash;&lsquo;Live and let Live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The procession was marshalled by Mr. Marpole Lewis, and after
parading the streets, was met by Mrs. Owen, of Glansevern, who was
accompanied by some lady friends and Mr. Brace, and at another point by Mr.
Whalley, the chairman of the company.&nbsp; These arrivals were
acknowledged with vociferous cheering.&nbsp; The procession, like a rolling
snowball, gained bulk as it proceeded, and before it reached the station,
comprehended a very large proportion of the inhabitants,&mdash;ladies and
gentlemen,&mdash;with a good sprinkling of their neighbours.&nbsp; At the
station there was a considerable delay, awaiting the arrival of the train
from Newtown.&nbsp; At last it made its appearance, and the band struck up
&lsquo;See the Conquering Hero comes,&rsquo;&mdash;an air far more
appropriate when applied to the &lsquo;locomotive&rsquo; than to one-half
of the heroes to whom it has hitherto done honour.&nbsp; The Mayor of
Llanidloes, with the Corporation, Mrs. Owen and party, and Mr. Whalley,
accompanied by a very large number of the inhabitants, then took their
seats, and amidst the cheers of those left behind, and counter cheers of
the passengers, the train moved off and proceeded slowly towards Newtown.
<a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The train arrived shortly after 12 o&rsquo;clock, when the
procession re-formed and escorted the Mayor and Corporation of Llanidloes,
Mrs. Owen, of Glansevern, Mr. Whalley, and other visitors, to Newtown Hall,
where an elegant <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>had been provided by
Dr. Slyman.&nbsp; The decorations at Newtown Hall were chaste and
beautiful.&nbsp; The verandah at the front, was tastefully ornamented with
flowers and evergreens, surmounted by a number of elegant fuschias, in the
centre of which stood out a prettily worked &lsquo;Prince of Wales&rsquo;
Feathers.&rsquo;&nbsp; A variety of flags were placed around the pleasure
ground, which gave a very striking effect to the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the party had partaken of refreshments, there were toasts and
mutual congratulations, and the procession tramped back to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again there was a little delay, awaiting the train from
Llanidloes (says our chronicler), and it was half-past three o&rsquo;clock
before <i>The Train</i> of the day fairly started.&nbsp; Filling the
carriages and trucks was no joke.&nbsp; Admirable arrangements had been
made, and the ladies were first accommodated with seats.&nbsp; One or two
gentlemen did attempt to take their place before this arrangement was fully
carried out, but they were very unceremoniously brought out again, amidst
the ironical cheers of the outsiders.&nbsp; At last the forty-eight trucks
and carriages were loaded, and, at a moderate estimate, we should say,
3,000 people were in the train.&nbsp; The two new engines, The Llewelyn and
The Milford, were attached to the carriages, and were driven by Mr. T. D.
Roberts and Mr. T. E. Minshall.&nbsp; Although the train was so heavily
laden with passengers, there was a large crowd of people left to cheer as
it slowly passed out of the Station.&nbsp; The appearance of this monster
train was magnificent.&nbsp; More than 2,000 of the passengers were in open
trucks, and at certain points, where there was a curve in the line, and a
good sight could be obtained, the train, as it wound its way through the
valley, presented a scene not easily to be erased from the memory.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Soon after four o&rsquo;clock Llanidloes Station was
reached, and the passengers alighted amidst the shouts of the inhabitants,
who had come to welcome them.&nbsp; A large circle was formed in the field
adjoining the Station, and Mr. Whalley introduced to those assembled Mrs.
Owen, of Glansevern, who declared the line to be opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It hardly required her stirring words to enlist the enthusiasm of the
company concerning the economic change which the railways were to bring to
Wales.&nbsp; Derelict acres were to be brought into cultivation; &ldquo;the
very central town of the ancient Principality,&rdquo; in which that
ceremony was taking place, was to become the capital of a new prosperity,
and as for Mr. Whalley, were not that day&rsquo;s proceedings &ldquo;a
chapter more honourable than any wreath of laurel that could be won on the
battle field by success in war?&rdquo;&nbsp; The plaudits of the assembled
confirmed the sentiment, and &ldquo;a rush was then made for the tent where
the luncheon was provided.&nbsp; Here again the ladies had the same proper
attention paid to them; the sterner sex was kept out until they could be
accommodated with seats.&nbsp; After a short delay the tent was well filled
with visitors, and upwards of 300 sat down to lunch.&nbsp; Grace was said
by the Rector of Llanidloes, and for a season the clatter of knives and
forks was the only sound to be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small wonder!&nbsp; For the afternoon was well advanced, and the
time-table had gone rather awry.&nbsp; But that did not in the least damp
the ardour of the company.&nbsp; Refreshed by their belated meal, more
toasts were honoured, more speeches made, and the future continued to
assume the most roseate hue.&nbsp; The district, declared one orator, was
destined to become &ldquo;the abode of smiling happiness,&rdquo; and
Newtown and Llanidloes &ldquo;the haunts and hives of social
industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, said another, the first link in a chain
&ldquo;which must, ere long, form <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>one of the greatest and most important trunk
lines in the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;People,&rdquo; exclaimed a third,
&ldquo;laughed at it because it had no head or tail&rdquo;; but let the
scoffers wait and see!&nbsp; With all these glowing anticipations,
proceedings became so protracted that the ladies had to withdraw, but the
gentlemen went on drinking toasts with undiminished energy.&nbsp; They
drank to the Chairman; they drank to the Secretary; they drank to the
Engineer, and the Contractors, and the Bankers who had lent them the money,
and to the success of the other railways springing up around them,
including the Mid-Wales, the first sod of which was to be cut in a few
days&rsquo; time, with what strange accompaniment will be noted in a
subsequent chapter.&nbsp; Not until the health of the
Press,&mdash;&ldquo;may its perfect independence ever expose abuses and
advocate what is just, through evil and through good
report,&rdquo;&mdash;had been duly honoured did the company disperse.</p>
<p>The workmen, too, were entertained, with good fare and more
speeches.&nbsp; Salvers and cake baskets were presented to Messrs. Davies
and Savin.&nbsp; Master Edward Davies, aged 5, and Master Tom Savin, aged
6, were held up aloft, and presented with watches, and the cheering, which
had gone on almost continuously for hours, broke forth afresh.&nbsp; One of
the workmen, who was also, at any rate, in the opinion of his colleagues,
something of a poet, stepped forward, and, &ldquo;amidst roars of laughter
and tremendous cheering,&rdquo; sang his thanks as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well now we&rsquo;ve got a railway,<br />
&nbsp;  The truth to you I&rsquo;ll tell,<br />

<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;When the song was concluded, Colonel Wynn purchased the
first copy, for which the fortunate bard received a shilling.&nbsp; Several
other gentlemen followed this example, and the poet must have regretted
that his stock in trade was so limited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the latter part of the proceedings, several had left the
enclosure to join the merry dance, to the strains of the Welshpool Band, in
the adjoining field.&nbsp; We cannot use the usual stock phrase of the
penny-a-liner and say to &lsquo;trip it on the light fantastic toe,&rsquo;
for in several instances a pair of stalwart navvies might be seen in
anything but dancing pumps kicking out most gloriously.&nbsp; In another
part of the field, a party were deeply engaged in an exciting game of
football.&nbsp; All was mirth and jollity.&nbsp; From the oldest to the
youngest, the richest to the poorest, every one seemed to try to get as
much enjoyment out of the evening as possible, and if there were any
grumblers to be found at Messrs. Davies and Savin&rsquo;s monster picnic,
the fault must have been with themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same evening rejoicings were being kept up at
Llanidloes.&nbsp; All the school children of the place were feasted in the
tent.&nbsp; Mr. Whalley (the &lsquo;champion of the people&rsquo;s
rights,&rsquo; as the flag had it) was chaired through the town, and the
evening was finished by a ball.&nbsp; And on the following day, several
loaves of bread and gallons of porter were sent by Messrs. Davies and Savin
to the poor people of Llandinam.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally, a medal was struck
in commemoration of the event, and presented to the workmen.</p>
<p>Thus, sixty-three years ago, did the community, already conscious of the
momentous influence the steam engine was exerting upon the social and
economic condition of the countryside, but yet to discover the not less
remarkable potentialities of the electric or the petrol spark applied to
the problems of transport, herald the birth of the infant Cambrian.</p>

<p>Though one or two earlier bubbles, blown by eager railway promoters, had
burst almost as they left the bowl of the pipe, the issue of the prospectus
of the Montgomeryshire Railways Company, in 1852, not unnaturally inspired
new hope in the border counties of some extension of already projected
lines in the locality.&nbsp; At Oswestry, in particular, there was a
rapidly growing feeling that such a development was overdue, and they
looked with eager eyes towards the possibility of forging a connecting link
with the system growing up in the heart of Powysland.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury
and Chester Railway, soon to become part of the Great Western, had opened
its branch to the busy Shropshire market centre under the hills at the
beginning of 1849,&mdash;the year which saw the birth of the Oswestry
Market and of the &ldquo;Oswestry Advertizer,&rdquo; which, in its earlier
years, was to devote so many pages to the record of the making of the
Cambrian.&nbsp; But beyond Oswestry travellers had to proceed by
coach.&nbsp; The <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>&ldquo;Royal Oak,&rdquo; leaving the town daily
at one o&rsquo;clock, arrived at Newtown about five.&nbsp; Goods were
carried by more ponderous road transport, and it is rather astonishing to
recal that as late as 1853 dogs were employed as draught animals, and local
records include the circumstance of the death of a &ldquo;respected
tradesman&rdquo; by a fall from his horse, caused by the animal&rsquo;s
&ldquo;fright at one of the carts drawn by the dogs, which are much too
often seen on the roads in this neighbourhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Legislation was
soon to prohibit this custom, and railways to make it unnecessary.</p>

<p>It was, then, in an Oswestry of very different social habits to those of
to-day that, on June 23rd, 1853, the townspeople assembled at the call of
the Mayor, Mr. William Hodges, to consider the question of a possible
extension of the &ldquo;Montgomeryshire Railway,&rdquo; in their direction,
which was declared by resolution to be the &ldquo;only scheme before
Parliament capable of effecting this most desirable object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But railways are not built by resolution alone, or the whole countryside
would soon have become heavy with steam.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it soon
was, but not the sort of steam which drives locomotives or urges on the
progress of practical railway construction.&nbsp; Ever since 1844, reliance
had been placed in the possibility of assistance from one or both of the
great lines which already had access to the Welsh border.&nbsp; Hope was
first centred in the North Western, which had designs on a line from
Shrewsbury into Montgomeryshire, but, in the Oswestry area, wistful eyes
turned towards Paddington, and in propitiation of expected favours to come,
four men with Great Western interests,&mdash;Mr. W. Ormsby-Gore, who became
its first chairman; Sir Watkin, who later succeeded him in the chair; Col.
Wynn, M.P., and Mr. Rowland James Venables,&mdash;were placed on the
Oswestry and Newtown Board.&nbsp; The Earl <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>of Powis, though a
&ldquo;North Westerner,&rdquo; was found to be not without ready desire to
look at things all round.&nbsp; He was for a line to Shrewsbury, and also a
line to Oswestry, but not to Oswestry alone.&nbsp; Even the line to
Oswestry, according to North Western notions, was to be a branch either
from Garthmyl or Criggion, according to whether the Shrewsbury and
Montgomeryshire line went by the Rea Valley or by Alberbury, and that was
not at all to Oswestrian taste.&nbsp; In the end, however, his lordship
agreed to support the Oswestry project, and to take the value of his
land,&mdash;some &pound;10,000,&mdash;in shares, provided the possessor of
Powis Castle was allowed to nominate a director, as the owner of Wynnstay
was on the Great Western Board.&nbsp; The condition was readily granted,
and the Oswestry and Newtown Bill, freed from North Western opposition, was
allowed to pass.&nbsp; It obtained Royal Assent on June 26th, 1855, and the
first general meeting was held at Welshpool on July 21st of that year.</p>
<p>Local rivalries, however, were not so easily dispelled.&nbsp;
Welshpool&rsquo;s impartiality as between the Shrewsbury and the Oswestry
lines was anathema at the latter town, where Mr. Whalley, speaking for
nearly an hour and a half, readily persuaded a great meeting to register
its insistence on the Oswestry scheme as an extension of the Llanidloes and
Newtown, and so form another link in the chain that was to bind Manchester
and Milford.&nbsp; Anyhow, Oswestry must be made &ldquo;the initial town
and not Newtown.&rdquo;&nbsp; In support of this the local promoters looked
for substantial aid from the Great Western.&nbsp; But that company proved
singularly unready to render any assistance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not only,&rdquo;
said Mr. Abraham Howell, in giving evidence before Lord Stanley&rsquo;s
Committee some years later, &ldquo;did the Great Western not aid in the
capital for the Oswestry, but they did not support the Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>On
the contrary they opposed it with all their efforts at every step.&nbsp;
They also, by a man&oelig;uvre which their position of power over the
Oswestry Company and their railway experience enabled them to carry out,
succeeded in separating the Shrewsbury from the main line, and causing it
to drift into the hands of the North Western.&nbsp; They, on the day of, or
immediately before the Wharncliffe meeting of the Oswestry Company, got
their friends to pay into the bankers in respect of their shares, and give
their proxies to the extent of the &frac14;th in money, against the clauses
in the Shrewsbury bill, by which it was intended to connect it with the
Oswestry.&nbsp; By this means they cut off from the Welsh line their head
and outlet at Shrewsbury, leaving them with the Oswestry head only, to
which place they, the Great Western, alone had access, and therefore, under
their exclusive power; a result which proved highly detrimental to the
Oswestry and the Welshpool lines.&nbsp; During the five years from 1855 to
1859 the advantage given to the Great Western interest placed our company
practically under their control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small wonder that public impatience began to show signs of strain.&nbsp;
Cynical allusions appeared in the Press.&nbsp; &ldquo;The only danger in
making oneself liable for new schemes,&rdquo; wrote one captious critic,
&ldquo;arises from the possibility of their being proceeded
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not even the &ldquo;glorious news&rdquo; of the fall of
Sebastopol sufficed to deflect the local mind from the irritating habits of
a dilatory directorate.&nbsp; After all, the Crimea was a long way
off,&mdash;much further than Chirk,&mdash;to which place, the Great Western
Company, on taking over the Shrewsbury and Chester line, had, under the
profession of &ldquo;revising&rdquo; the fares, substantially raised
them.&nbsp; This habit is one to which the community has become more
accustomed in recent years, but that was a first experience of the ways of
powerful <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>monopolists, and it effectively emphasised the contention that it
was high time &ldquo;an independent&rdquo; railway company, more directly
under local control, should materialise.</p>
<p>Addresses were exchanged between Oswestry and Welshpool, much after the
manner of diplomatic &ldquo;Notes,&rdquo; some of them phrased in the
spirited language which diplomats know so well how to cloak in conventional
formulas.&nbsp; Occasionally even the conventional formulas were dispensed
with.&nbsp; Questions concerning the legality of certain assemblies were
pugnaciously raised and as pugnaciously answered.&nbsp; Four hours&rsquo;
somewhat heated discussion at an extraordinary meeting of shareholders at
Welshpool carried matters no further than the decision that the first sod,
when it was cut, should be of Montgomeryshire soil, &ldquo;but
whether,&rdquo; adds a critical commentator, &ldquo;at Llanymynech,
Welshpool or Newtown, no one knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fresh controversy arose
concerning the secretaryship, to which office Mr. Princep had been
appointed by Mr. Ormsby-Gore, after a very fleeting appearance on the
kaleidoscopic scene of a Mr. Farmer, and the old rivalry of Great Western
and North Western &ldquo;interests&rdquo; re-appeared in fresh form.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Oswestry Advertizer,&rdquo; pointing the warning finger at the
fate of another Welsh railway which, after &pound;25,000 out of a total
capital of &pound;400,000 had been raised, found everything
&ldquo;swallowed up in the gulph of Chancery&rdquo; under the winding-up
Acts, proclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;We are almost afraid the Oswestry and
Newtown is doomed to the same end.&rdquo;&nbsp; It certainly looked as if a
true prophet was writing that dirge!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly possible,&rdquo; says Mr. Howell, &ldquo;to conceive
a more deplorable state than that to which the company was reduced during
this period of five years of Great-western <i>regime</i>.&nbsp; Every
shilling that could be realized of the proceeds <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of a very superior
share list was expended, debt was accumulated, every resource was
exhausted; but comparatively little was done in the execution of the works;
the company was involved in four chancery suits, of large proportions, and
a law suit, and with other suits in prospect.&nbsp; It was necessary to
provide &pound;45,000 in cash, towards relieving the chairman from a
personal liability of &pound;75,000, and to let free the action of the
company from the chancery suits; also further sums to discharge the claims
of the contractors and carry on the works.&rdquo;&nbsp; So moribund,
indeed, did the whole affair seem, that the North Western, treating it as
practically extinct, began to consider a scheme for converting the
Shropshire Union Canal, already in their hands, as a railway to
Newtown!</p>
<p>And here were the promoters of this ill-starred project fighting amongst
themselves.&nbsp; One party was for keeping back the line from Oswestry
till, as a newspaper writer put it, &ldquo;a rival to Shrewsbury is brought
into condition to do it damage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another was for complicating
it with other new schemes.&nbsp; One of the sternest of all controversies
still raged round the moot point whether the line was to run from Oswestry
to Newtown or from Newtown to Oswestry, and even private friends fell out
as to the exact spot on the proposed route at which the actual work should
begin!&nbsp; &ldquo;Discord triumphs&mdash;local prejudice is
rampart&mdash;personal ill-will abounds&mdash;as a necessary consequence no
one will apply for the unappropriated shares.&nbsp; Dissolution alone is
imminent,&rdquo; cries the distracted editor.</p>
<p>It was certainly becoming apparent that this was no time for further
dallying.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Welshpool undertaking, it was reported,
was enlisting &ldquo;an amount of public interest and support seldom
equalled in the history of railways,&rdquo; <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>and early in 1856 the
directors of the Oswestry and Newtown line found it expedient to assure the
community that &ldquo;preparations for letting the contract were in active
progress&rdquo; and the first sod was to be cut on April 11th.&nbsp; Alas
for the optimism of eager pioneers and the credulity of an impatient
public!&nbsp; April 11th came and proved nothing else than a slightly
belated &ldquo;All Fools Day&rdquo;!&nbsp; No sod was cut.&nbsp; Not a
spade or a barrow was visible, and the operation might, by all appearances
be postponed till the Greek Kalends.&nbsp; Patience, already sorely tried,
became utterly exhausted.&nbsp; In June the Shrewsbury and Welshpool
Railway Bill was read a third time in the House of Commons, and thus the
rival scheme loomed still larger upon the horizon.&nbsp; Men had yet to
learn that railways could be co-operative as well as competitive.</p>
<p>But so fully, indeed, was the popular mind at that time obsessed with
the rivalry of routes that a rumour was started imputing to the directors
of the Oswestry and Newtown Company the intention of &ldquo;disuniting the
line between Oswestry and Welshpool.&rdquo;&nbsp; As if there were not
disunion enough already!&nbsp; More genial humorists launched the story
that the Prince of Wales was coming down expressly to cut the first sod and
had ordered a new pair of &ldquo;navvys&rdquo; for the occasion to be made
by a Welshpool bootmaker.&nbsp; Feeling, however, was rising again, which
was not moderated by the apologia of the directorate suggestive that it was
all due to differences between them and the engineers.&nbsp; The engineers
themselves were more or less at variance, and, in April 1856, Mr. Barlow,
the chief, finding it impossible to agree with his assistant, Mr. Piercy,
resigned.</p>
<p>Matters had come to so critical a juncture that eventually, by some
happy inspiration, a &ldquo;committee of investigation&rdquo; <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>was appointed
to examine &ldquo;the affairs, position and financial state of the
Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. C. T. C. Luxmoore was elected to preside at
this inquiry with Mr. Peploe Cartwright of Oswestry as his deputy, and they
issued a voluminous report containing a series of recommendations, of which
one of the most interesting is that, to reduce expenditure, the earthworks
should be limited to a single line, &ldquo;in all other respects making
preparations for a double line.&rdquo;&nbsp; That, as travellers over the
Cambrian to-day are aware, save for the length between Oswestry and
Llanymynech, and between Buttington and Welshpool on the Oswestry and
Newtown section, was eventually the course adopted.&nbsp; Bridges,
including those over the Vyrnwy at Llanymynech, and the Severn at Pool
Quay, were built with an extra span for a second pair of rails, but the
girders still remain without further completion.&nbsp; The directors did
not escape pointed reference to their &ldquo;heavy responsibilities,&rdquo;
but there was at least the &ldquo;consolitary fact&rdquo; that, despite
enormous expenditure already incurred, &ldquo;provided the arrears of
deposit, calls and interest are paid up, a sum of &pound;60,000 over and
above the Parliamentary deposit of &pound;18,000 invested in the hands of
the Accountant-General, will be at once available for the works, an amount
little short of sufficient to form half the line,&rdquo; and the
shareholders are urged, &ldquo;manfully confronting the difficulties that
present themselves&rdquo; to &ldquo;merge all local jealousies and
differences of opinion, in a hearty and unanimous effort to carry out the
works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a long and tortuous story and well may a journalist of those days,
bemoan the perplexity of the local historian &ldquo;when he turns over the
files of the various newspapers, to see in one number the praises of
certain gentlemen sung by admiring editors and enthusiastic correspondents,
and in the <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>next frantic outbursts from distracted shareholders against the
devoted heads of the same gentlemen, who, but one short week before were
the admired of all the shareholding admirers.&nbsp; One week he would find
a noble lord wafted to the skies on the breath of a public meeting, but in
the next &lsquo;the breath thus vainly spent&rsquo; would blow his lordship
up in a very different fashion, and those whose cheers had wafted my lord
to that elevated position, would fain keep him there, so that sublunary
affairs as far as regarded railways, would be out of his reach.&nbsp; Then
he would find another gentleman on the directory, one day the idol and
leading speaker of every meeting, called on the next a
&lsquo;strife-engendering-judge,&rsquo; and his place filled by another on
the board.&nbsp; Presto! and this same gentleman, again turns up
trumps!&nbsp; A professional gentleman is the pet of the whole company, but
speedily a woe is pronounced upon lawyers.&nbsp; Again the wheel turns
round, and the solicitor&rsquo;s great exertions and painstaking attention
to the interests of the line are acknowledged.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our historian would next discover &lsquo;much talkee&rsquo; (as
John Chinaman would say) anent a certain, or rather uncertain,
&lsquo;blighting influence&rsquo; which arrested the progress of some of
the works, and to get to the bottom of which a &lsquo;committee of
investigation&rsquo; was appointed.&nbsp; He would open his eyes when he
saw the revelations made by that committee, and would wonder how in the
name of fortune&mdash;or misfortune&mdash;the shareholders could be such
&lsquo;geese&rsquo; (to apply a term <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>used by one of the best
directors the line ever had) as to allow affairs to go on as they had
done.&nbsp; He would find that committee triumphant in the praises of the
people, but snubbed by another committee who conducted the ceremony of
cutting a first sod that would not have been cut this century but for
them.&nbsp; When the investigation committee&rsquo;s work was ended (but
not finished!) he would find rival claimants for honour:&mdash;Mr. Soandso
here, Mr. Whatshisname there, and other gentlemen elsewhere discovering
that they were the &lsquo;saviours of the
line&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;unravellers of the mystery&rsquo; while the line
was yet in jeopardy, and the mystery as dark as Erebus.&nbsp; He would then
go on to disputes with contractors and engineers, a law suit commenced
here, and threatened there,&mdash;directors retiring, and shareholders
well-nigh at their wits end.&nbsp; Lawyers are again at a
&lsquo;Premium&rsquo; and three are appointed to lay their heads together
in order to make heads of agreement, for the guidance of new contractors,
while the old ones, who the shareholders were afraid would sack the
company, were themselves sacked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, indeed, is the usual fate of those who attempt to follow dead
controversies through their never-ending labyrinths.&nbsp; A sentimental
historian has said that &ldquo;the world is full of the odour of faded
violets&rdquo;; but, in looking back over these yellow pages of the past,
the scent which greets us is sometimes hardly as fragrant; and were it not
for purposes of comprehensive record, many of these acrid, but not
unamusing, incidents might be decently left buried in oblivion.&nbsp;
Happily, however, even the battle of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway was
not eternal.&nbsp; The day dawned on which it was gleefully acclaimed that
the directors had at length &ldquo;caught the spirit of promptitude from
the committee&rdquo; and before long &ldquo;it might be expected to see
hundreds of <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>navvies engaged in cutting up the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Storm clouds
might re-gather later, as we shall see, but for the time being peace was
restored.</p>
<p>Differences as to policy and even as to the site of the sod cutting were
sufficiently composed by the summer of 1857 to admit of a start being made
with the work of construction, and on Tuesday, August 4th, the initial
ceremony, performed by Lady Williams Wynn, took place, in a field on the
east side and adjoining the bowling green at Welshpool.&nbsp; The spot
bears no mark to-day, as it might well do, but it may be mentioned that it
is between the rails on the down line, as you enter Welshpool station from
Buttington, just opposite the signal box.&nbsp; There were, needless to
say, great public rejoicings.&nbsp; The long delay in getting to the actual
stage of operations gave additional zest to the popular acclaim when that
point had, at last, been really reached, and the proceedings were of the
most effective and striking character.&nbsp; Crowds flocked in from all
sides.&nbsp; Montgomery shared fully in the popular acclamation, and only
Oswestry, among the interested towns, stood somewhat aloof.&nbsp; The
question of &ldquo;priority,&rdquo; apparently, still rankled, and
&ldquo;some misunderstanding&rdquo; spoilt the effect of what was intended
to be a general business holiday.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only two or three shops were
closed, while the others remained open as usual,&rdquo; and some of the
more prominent Oswestry shareholders were conspicuous by their absence at
the ceremony, at which no reference was made to the expediting influence of
the &ldquo;committee of investigation.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>But in Welshpool the streets were bright with bunting.&nbsp; At noon
shops were closed in order that everyone might participate in the
ceremonial.&nbsp; Bells pealed from the Church tower; cannon,
&ldquo;captured at Seringapatam by the great <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Lord Clive&rdquo; were
fired from Powys Castle, and a committee, headed by the Mayor (Mr. Owen,
grandfather of Mr. Robert Owen of Broad Street), who had taken an active
interest in the promotion of both the Oswestry and Shrewsbury lines,
assisted by the Town Clerk, carried the day&rsquo;s programme through in
triumph, which included the inevitable &ldquo;procession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A contemporary record may here supply us with the necessary
details:&mdash;&ldquo;The Procession began to form in the Powis Castle
Park.&nbsp; After some little delay it proceeded towards the Bowling Green,
in the following order:&mdash;</p>
<p>Two Marshals, on Horseback.</p>
<p>A body of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry Cavalry dismounted.</p>
<p>The Band.</p>
<p>The Mayor and High Sheriff.</p>
<p>Aldermen and Town Councillors of the Borough of Welshpool.</p>
<p>The wheel-barrow to be used by Lady Williams Wynn, in performing the

<p>Cambrian Friendly Society.</p>
<p>Flags and Banners.</p>
<p>A small body of the Royal Montgomeryshire Rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This possession extended to a very considerable length, and was
followed by an immense concourse of pleasure-seekers and others who had
come to the town for the purpose of witnessing the ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body of Yeomanry Cavalry were selected by Sergeant-Major
Turner, as a body-guard for Lady Wynn during the ceremony, and being in
full dress presented a very creditable appearance.</p>
<h3>THE CEREMONY.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;At about one o&rsquo;clock the procession arrived at the spot
where the ceremony was to be performed.&nbsp; This, we have stated before,
was on the east side of the Bowling Green, on the part of the mound on that
side of the green facing the spot, seats were placed which were occupied by
anxious and eager spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the procession had been properly arranged around the spot,
the ceremony was at once proceeded with,&rdquo; not the least impressive
item in it being the solemn invocation by Archdeacon Clive that &ldquo;God
would bless the undertaking in the name of His Son Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mayor then presented Lady Wynn with a copy of the
programme of the day&rsquo;s proceedings printed in gold letters on blue
silk; Mrs. Owen of Glansevern read a learned address dipping deep in the
classical history of transport, &ldquo;the first sod was then cut by Lady
Wynn, with the silver spade placed in the wheelbarrow provided by the
contractor, and wheeled by her along the planks laid on the ground, in a
very graceful manner.&nbsp; <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Her ladyship performed the ceremony amidst the
deafening applause of the assembled multitude.&nbsp; Afterwards other
ladies and gentlemen, including the directors, contractors, engineers,
etc., went through the same ceremony, using a common wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wheelbarrow, made of mahogany, was emblazoned with the seal
of the company, while on the silver spade was engraved the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Presented to Lady Watkin Williams Wynn, by the Contractor of the
Oswestry and Newtown Railway, on the occasion of turning the first sod, at
Welchpool, on Tuesday, the 4th of August, 1857.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Under the inscription was a copy of the seal of the
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subsequently a &ldquo;cold collation&rdquo; was provided in a tent on
the Bowling Green; there was a prolific toasting of everybody, or nearly
everybody concerned, and what was felt to be one of the most auspicious
days in the annals of Powysland closed with rural sports and dancing.&nbsp;
That night the shareholders dreamt of prodigious dividends.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to-day to smile at the optimism of our grand-fathers.&nbsp;
We know now that railway dividends are not as readily earned in real life
as they sometimes are in dreams which follow gorgeous banquets; but, in one
respect, at any rate, the future of the Oswestry and Newtown undertaking
appeared to justify jubilation.&nbsp; Axes had been, at any rate,
temporarily buried; the advocates of rival routes had composed their
differences and everything pointed to a rapid consummation of the
scheme.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, little delay was experienced in getting
to work with the actual construction.&nbsp; Before October opened gangs of
labourers were busy on the track between Pant and Llandysilio.&nbsp; The
original idea of a broad gauge line, similar to that adopted by Brunel on
the Great Western&rsquo;s southern arm, had been abandoned in favour of
what has since become the standard one for this country of 4ft.

class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Nevertheless, it was no small undertaking.&nbsp; The Vyrnwy had to
be crossed at Llanymynech and the Severn at Pool Quay and again near
Buttington.&nbsp; The rest of the line was comparatively free from serious
engineering problems, but fresh Parliamentary powers had to be obtained to
construct a branch from Llynclys to the Porthywaen lime quarries, and even
a little addition of this sort involved endless correspondence over details
and other wearing worries.&nbsp; Difficulties of another sort, more
formidable, began to appear.&nbsp; The Earl of Powis, whose influence
counted for so much, expressing regret for certain differences which had
arisen in relation to the policy of the Board, wrote to Sir Watkin
resigning his seat, adding the warning note, &ldquo;I think you should for
your own sake watch somewhat jealously the proceedings with regard to the
contract.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Watkin hastened to assure his lordship of the
&ldquo;grief and astonishment&rdquo; which his withdrawal had occasioned
his colleagues and to deprecate divisions at critical hours.</p>
<p>And it certainly was a critical hour.&nbsp; Money was urgently wanted,
borrowing was barred until provisions of the Act were complied with, and
though an attempt by Mr. Barlow to seek an injunction in Chancery failed
after a hard struggle, the contract had to be dissolved in order to
substitute an arrangement by which payment could be made by shares and
debentures in lieu of cash.&nbsp; It was on this account that Messrs.
Davidson and Oughterson, who had earlier succeeded Messrs. Thornton and
McCormick, in turn gave place to the men who had already come to the rescue
of the Newtown and Llanidloes undertaking.</p>
<p>The arrangements by which these early undertakings were
&ldquo;leased&rdquo; to the contractors has been the subject of controversy
among railway financial experts, but they were <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>stoutly defended in a
letter to the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; shortly after the completion of most of
them by Mr. David Davies himself, who claimed that by this means
&ldquo;Wales had the benefit of something like 700 miles of railway which
would not have been made for at least another century if we had waited for
the localities to subscribe the necessary funds.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
present case, at any rate, Mr. Savin&rsquo;s efforts at financial
re-establishment were the outcome of the suggestion of the North Western,
warmly supported by the Great Western party, including the Chairman
himself, who had become practically liable for &pound;75,000, if the
railway was not made and the company set upon a sound footing.&nbsp; To set
free the powers of the Company no less than &pound;45,000 had to be paid
down, no small task with subscriptions to the share list not easy to
obtain.&nbsp; Yet, that Mr. Savin accomplished&mdash;and more.&nbsp; He
bought up the existing contract, compromised and settled all existing
claims and got rid of all liabilities.&nbsp; The rearrangement, however,
took a great deal of time, and was later complicated by the dissolution of
partnership between him and Mr. Davies, while the works were proceeding
between Welshpool and Newtown.&nbsp; Not until July 26th, 1861, was it
finally arranged that Mr. Savin should relinquish the lease, and work the
line on an amended basis, under which he was to take the earnings, pay
4&frac34; per cent. to the Company, supplementing the earnings of the line
by a draft upon the North Western, who granted rebates. <a

</a></p>
<p>Still, it considerably expedited construction.&nbsp; The works came into
the new hands in October 1859, and so far as the chief portions of the
undertaking went, progress became quite satisfactory.&nbsp; As is so often
the case, in these affairs, <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>it was an unexpected development over a detail
that caused the greatest perturbation.&nbsp; Another difference arising on
the board, this time regarding certain engagements entered into about the
site of the station at Oswestry, Sir Watkin, who appears to have had
certain misgivings as to the conduct of the business, being out-voted at a
meeting of the directors, just before Mr. Savin came into possession of the
works, in his turn left the room and a few days later sent in his
resignation.&nbsp; He was replaced in the chair by Mr. David Pugh, M.P., of
Llanerchyddol Hall, Welshpool, who continued to act in that capacity till,
on his death in 1861, he was succeeded by Mr. Whalley.</p>
<p>On the line, however, the navvies went doggedly digging on, despite
atrocious weather.&nbsp; By May 1st, 1860, the track was sufficiently
complete from Oswestry to Pool Quay to be opened for traffic to that point,
and advertisements began to appear announcing &ldquo;cheap trains&rdquo;
for excursionists to the &ldquo;far-famed and commanding heights of
Llanymynech Hills.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the middle of the month a more
venturesome journey was attempted and, by the grace of God, safely
accomplished.&nbsp; The last link in the iron road had just been laid, a
mile or two from Welshpool, and one fine evening, &ldquo;shortly after six
o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; (as a local journalist records) &ldquo;the
&lsquo;Montgomery&rsquo; was attached to a number of trucks, with rough
seats placed on them for the occasion.&nbsp; Every available space was
filled by a number of Poolonians who were in waiting.&nbsp; The train then
slowly proceeded along the beautiful valley of the Severn to the Cefn
Junction <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> (that is to be) with the Shrewsbury and Welshpool
line, where more trucks were attached, and a considerable addition to the
passengers made.&nbsp; <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Soon Welshpool was reached, and the shrill
whistle of the engine&mdash;for the first time heard in that beautiful
locality&mdash;was all but overpowered by the cheers of the assembled
people.&nbsp; The train was brought to a standstill on the very spot where,
some years ago (we are afraid to say how many) the first sod was cut.&nbsp;
Congratulations were passed, and crowds of the very old, and the very
young, to whom an Engine heretofore had been a figment of imagination,
gazed with wonder at &lsquo;The Montgomery&rsquo; while their more
travelled neighbours adjourned to the Bowling Green, where Mr. R. Owen made
a short pithy speech.&nbsp; He very properly acknowledged the business-like
activity of Messrs. Davies and Savin, to whom the public were so largely
indebted for the arrival of a locomotive at Welshpool.&nbsp; Mr. Webb, on
behalf of the contractors, suitably responded; and the proceedings were cut
short by a warning whistle from the engine, on which sat Campbell, the
locomotive superintendent, who very prudently wished to get back over the
rough road before the shades of evening overtook them.&nbsp; The train then
went off for Pool Quay at a smart pace, considering that the rails were
unballasted, and with the trucks loaded with juveniles, many of whom
perhaps had this day their first trip by railway.&nbsp; In Welshpool the
bells rang out merry peals, and cannons were fired, and everything
betokened the hilarity of the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the Board of Trade would say nowadays to a heavily-ladened train of
passengers being run at a &ldquo;smart pace,&rdquo; or any other, over an
&ldquo;unballasted&rdquo; road, can be left to the reader&rsquo;s
imagination!</p>
<p>Anyhow, the line being finally finished off to the last nut and bolt,
was soon approved of by the Government Inspector, Colonel Yolland; and
everything was ready for the formal <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>opening on Tuesday,
August 14th.&nbsp; &ldquo;The day (says a contemporary account) proved most
auspicious.&nbsp; Early in the morning the weather was very dull, but
before the middle of the day it cleared up, and turned out most bright and
cheerful.&nbsp; At about a quarter to eleven o&rsquo;clock the Mayor and
Corporation of Welshpool met at the Town Hall, and from thence proceeded
(headed by the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry Band) to the Railway Station by
eleven, in time for the train that was to convey them, together with the
directors, shareholders, and general public to Oswestry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As may be readily supposed, a monster train was required for this
purpose, and an immense number of carriages were in readiness.&nbsp; After
some delay, the passengers took their seats, and the train started for
Oswestry.&nbsp; The Corporation were followed by the Montgomeryshire
Militia Band, and the 2nd Montgomeryshire Rifle Volunteers, who proceeded
to Oswestry by the same train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the train proceeded on its course, and arrived at the various
stations, it was hailed with the most enthusiastic greetings from those who
assembled along the line as spectators on this occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arrival of the train at Oswestry was made the signal for a
general discharge of artillery, such as is customarily used on these
occasions, and added to this was the discharge of a great number of
fog-signals.&nbsp; The bells of the Old Church, too, rang out their
merriest peals.&nbsp; At the Station an immense concourse of people had
assembled, and the Welshpool Corporation was received by the Mayor and
Corporation of Oswestry, who had been escorted to the Station by the Rifle
Corps, headed by their band.&nbsp; The Pool Corporation received a hearty
greeting from their civic brethren in Oswestry, and the Montgomeryshire
Rifles formed in column opposite the <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Oswestry Corps, and
each presented arms, when the Oswestry Band struck up &ldquo;God save the
Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; They all then proceeded, in the following order, to the
Powis Hall:&mdash;</p>
<p>Banner.&nbsp; Banner.</p>
<p>Band and Members of the Oswestry Rifle Corps.</p>
<p>Band and Members of the 2nd Montgomeryshire Rifle Corps.</p>
<p>Band of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry.</p>
<p>The Mayor and Corporation of Welshpool.</p>
<p>The Mayor and Corporation of Oswestry.</p>
<p>Tradesmen, Shareholders, etc.</p>
<p>Drum and Fife Band.</p>
<p>Navvies, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Town Hall the Corporation had most hospitably provided for
their refreshment.&nbsp; Punch and wine of the choicest and best
descriptions were abundantly supplied, under the management of Mr. Atkins,
and Mrs. Edwards, of the Queen&rsquo;s Head Hotel, Oswestry.&nbsp; The
company present included the Oswestry Corporation, the Welshpool
Corporation, the directors of the railway, the Second Montgomeryshire
Volunteers, and the Oswestry Volunteers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The special train then returned to Welshpool, where Mrs. Owen of
Glansevern declared the line opened.&nbsp; Then the inevitable procession,
and the not less inevitable &ldquo;cold collation&rdquo; and speech making,
and dancing.&nbsp; Only one untoward incident marked the day.&nbsp; Owing
to the crush to board the returning train from Oswestry, the
Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and Montgomeryshire Militia bands got left behind,
and the Oswestry Rifle Corps musicians, who had been more successful in the
scramble, had to do all the blowing for their stranded comrades.&nbsp; But,
it is recorded, they blew with triple vigour, as well they might!</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Oswestry was now, at long last, connected with Montgomeryshire,
but there were those who felt in no mood for rejoicing in that event.&nbsp;
Among the residents of the Severn Valley were those who, like the
redoubtable Mr. Weller &ldquo;considered that the rail is unconstitootional
and an inwader o&rsquo; privileges.&rdquo;&nbsp; They solemnly shook their
heads and deplored the doom of the mail-coach.&nbsp; What, they asked, was
to become of Tustin?&nbsp; Tustin had driven the mail coach from Shrewsbury
every morning, summer and winter, starting from the Post Office at 4 a.m.,
and covering the score of miles to Welshpool in about two hours.&nbsp; To
see him and his fine horses arrive at the Royal Oak was a source of daily
pride to Welshpolonians.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the summer mornings,&rdquo; says a
writer in the &ldquo;Licensing Victualler&rsquo;s Gazette&rdquo; in 1878,
looking back upon those days, &ldquo;there was always a number of people up
to see the mail arrive, and the cordial and cheery welcome given to those
passengers who alighted to partake of breakfast at the hotel, by the buxom
and genial landlady, Mrs. Whitehall, was a thing to be remembered and
talked about.&nbsp; She was the pink of what such a woman should be, and
the fame of her cuisine reached very far beyond the county in which she
lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later in the morning, the thirteen miles between
Welshpool and Newtown were done in little more than an hour.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;the days of coaching were drawing to a close even in Wales; the iron
horse was slowly to elbow one coach and then another off the road, putting
them back as it were, nearer and nearer to the coast; until even Tustin and
his famous Aberystwyth mail had to succumb.&nbsp; But they made a gallant
fight of it, and died what we may call gamely.&rdquo;&nbsp; In recent years
the coach, or its modern counterpart, the charabanc and motor bus, have
come into something of their own again, and are providing, in turn, a new
form of competition with the railways.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>In
1860, long distance highway traffic did seem doomed, for the &ldquo;iron
horse&rdquo; could cover the ground in what then appeared a prodigious
pace.&nbsp; Six trains ran each way between Oswestry and Welshpool on
week-days and two each way on Sundays, while excursion fares advertised in
connection with a Sunday School trip from Oswestry to Welshpool held out
the alluring advantage of &ldquo;covered carriages, 1s.; first-class,
2s.&rdquo; for the double journey&mdash;a figure to make the mouth of the
present day passenger water!&nbsp; It was hardly so necessary then, as it
has proved to be on recent occasions, to the writer&rsquo;s personal
knowledge, for groups of mourners travelling to a funeral to contrive to
save a few pence by taking &ldquo;pleasure party&rdquo; tickets!</p>
<p>But, as yet, no &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; or any other party could proceed
by rail beyond Welshpool.&nbsp; Work on the remaining link, had begun; but
at the Newtown end, where arrangements had been entered into for a working
alliance with the Newtown and Llanidloes Railway.&nbsp; At the Welshpool
end circumstances were not so propitious.&nbsp; The original surveys had
been made by way of Berriew, but this necessitated carrying the line
through part of the Glansevern domain, and, as the late Earl of Powis had
jocularly remarked, in connection with the planning of a neighbouring line,
the <i>beau ideal</i> of a railway is one that comes about a mile from
one&rsquo;s own house and passes through a neighbour&rsquo;s land.</p>

</a></p>
<p>So it was to the other side of the valley that Mr. Piercy had, at
length, to carry his measuring instruments, and, crossing the Severn at
Kilkewydd, climb the long incline to Forden.&nbsp; Before this was finally
accomplished the dissolution of partnership between the contractors had
taken place, and while Mr. Davies transferred his attention to some
adjacent <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>railway schemes, Mr. Savin took into partnership Mr. Ward of the
Donnett, Whittington, near Oswestry, and the name of &ldquo;Savin and
Ward&rdquo; was, for some years, to become as familiar in the railway world
as had previously been that of &ldquo;Davies and Savin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
four mile stretch between Newtown and Abermule was in working order and
trains were running over this isolated section of the Oswestry and Newtown
system, but the remaining gap between Abermule and Welshpool had still to
receive its finishing touches, when the term set in the agreement for
completion expired.</p>
<p>Mr. Savin was able to cite not only the &ldquo;worst weather that anyone
can remember,&rdquo; but the procrastination over the arrangement and
transfer of the lease as ample justification for the delay in fulfilling
the engagement.&nbsp; Moreover, other matters were arising which tended to
distract the attention of the directors from any passing squabble as to
dates.&nbsp; The &ldquo;overbearing leviathians&rdquo; might have been
quelled some years earlier, but they had not been killed, and at the
beginning of 1861, movements were again afoot in North-Western circles to
secure an extension of the Minsterley branch to Montgomery, while under the
Bishop&rsquo;s Castle Railway Bill, which was going through the Committee
of the House of Lords, the London and North Western Railway, apparently
trading on the payment made to the Oswestry and Newtown Company for access
to Welshpool by way of Buttington, sought a further reciprocal arrangement
by which, if the Oswestry and Newtown availed themselves of the powers to
subscribe to, lease, or work the Bishop&rsquo;s Castle line, the North
Western was to obtain the right to run over the Oswestry and Newtown metals
into Newtown, the latter Company being given a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the
shape of similar advantage <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>over the Shrewsbury and Welshpool line.&nbsp;
It seemed an innocent enough proposal on the surface, but it did not blind
the astute Mr. Whalley to the danger of certain developments favourable to
North Western interests.&nbsp; The clause, as it happened, had been
inserted in the absence of any representatives of the Oswestry and Newtown
Company, and this objection was carried into the committee room.&nbsp; For
hours the arguments swayed to and fro.&nbsp; Numbers of witnesses,
including officials of the Oswestry and Newtown, gave evidence; and, in the
end, the anticipated compromise was affected, by withdrawals all
round.&nbsp; The Bishop&rsquo;s Castle Railway lost the support of the
Oswestry and Newtown, but the sinister designs of the North Western upon
Newtown were finally scotched, and the local Company, of which Mr. Robert
B. Elwin was now General Manager, and Mr. B. Tanner, who had not long
succeeded Mr. Hayward, on his resignation, in that capacity on the
Llanidloes and Newtown, secretary, could go forward with greater
confidence.</p>
<p>On Monday, May 27th, the first train, drawn by the engine
&ldquo;Leighton,&rdquo; and conveying a party of invited guests and the
engineers, passed safely over Kilkewydd bridge, amidst a fusillade of fog
signals, and thus the last and most formidable of the engineering exploits
on the new length of line was accomplished.&nbsp; The bridge had been
constructed in remarkably short time, and a contemporary record of this
auspicious incident duly mentions that &ldquo;the speedy completion of so
complicated and troublesome a task is mainly due to the indefatigable
exertions of Mr. John Ward, one of the contractors, and Mr. James Marshall,
the resident superintendent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Early the next month Colonel
Yolland inspected the whole length from Welshpool to Newtown, pausing to
express his <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>special approbation of the Kilkewydd bridge <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> as
&ldquo;the best constructed on the line,&rdquo; and it was now open to the
Company publicly to announce that from June 10th a through service of
trains would run from Oswestry to Newtown and on to Llanidloes.</p>
<p>No further formal opening seems to have been arranged, but, though the
day was, like so many that had so proceeded it, very wet, rapidly organised
celebrations took place at some spots.&nbsp; Montgomery had already taken
its share in the opening to Welshpool, but it was now to have a festival of
its own, as was only fitting, since that ancient borough may, in no small
sense, be regarded as one of the ancestral homes of the
&ldquo;Cambrian.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was here, as we have seen, that Mr. Piercy
had largely acquired his interest and skill in railway engineering, while
at the office of Mr. Charles Mickleburgh.&nbsp; A committee, with Mr. W.
Mickleburgh as hon. secretary, and treasurer, had little difficulty in
getting together some &pound;150 as a celebration fund.&nbsp; A programme
was as quickly organised, including, of course, a procession and a dinner,
but to this was added another little ceremony,&mdash;the presentation by
Mrs. Owen of Glansevern, now a familiar central figure on these occasions,
of a silver bugle to Captain Johns and his gallant men of the Railway
Volunteers.&nbsp; The instrument bore the
inscription,&mdash;&ldquo;Presented by Anne Warburton Owen, of Glansevern,
to the Third Montgomeryshire (Railway) Rifles, 1861.&rdquo;&nbsp; Above was
an appropriate design, on the dexter side a representation of the
locomotive engine &ldquo;Glansevern,&rdquo; and on the sinister a railway
viaduct with a train passing over.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>The occasion was singularly appropriate, for no small part in the
initiation and maintenance of the Corps belongs to the little group of
railway men who were associated with Montgomery, the Mickleburghs, Mr.
George Owen, Mr. Piercy and others.&nbsp; In after years it was the habit
of their children to ask these gallant men whether they had &ldquo;ever
really killed anyone&rdquo; with their formidable swords, and some of them
were wont to answer that, perhaps not, but they had taken their part in the
&ldquo;battle of Aberystwyth,&rdquo; a somewhat mysterious affair among the
plum stalls in the market-place, possibly still remembered by men well
advanced in years.&nbsp; In any case, we may be quite sure they would have
acquitted themselves worthily if called upon, and they did indeed provide
an inspiring note to all such ceremonial festivities.&nbsp; On this
auspicious day of the opening of the line, to Mr. Ashford, the trumpeter of
the Corps, fell the honour of sounding the first blast, and amidst the
cheers of the countryside, some 600 ladies and gentlemen fell to dancing
&ldquo;to the music of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and Militia Bands, and
the capital band of the Welshpool Cadet Corps, composed of the young
gentlemen of Mr. Browne&rsquo;s academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, at long last, trains were to run through from Oswestry to
Llanidloes.&nbsp; Six left Oswestry every weekday, the first timed to
depart at 7 a.m., passing all the intermediate stations (including
Arddleen, now added to the original five) to Welshpool without a stop,
though this &ldquo;express&rdquo; was taken off the daily list some months
later, and only ran on fair days.&nbsp; Four trains made the reverse
journey from Llanidloes to Oswestry; while two trains ran each way on
Sundays&mdash;a more generous service even than that afforded to-day!&nbsp;
The Cambrian, as someone said, might still be a child, but it was a rapidly
growing child.&nbsp; The guiding hand was at work, and additional limbs
were shaping themselves, both at the Newtown and Oswestry end of the
system, with such rapidity that we can best deal with them one by one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wales is a land of mountains.&nbsp; Its mountains explain its
isolation and its love of independence; they explain its internal
divisions; they have determined, throughout its history, what the direction
and method of its progress were to be</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The Late Sir O. M. Edwards</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>So far the lines already opened or under construction only traversed the
valley of the Severn.&nbsp; It was now proposed to penetrate the uplands
which lie between the banks of Sabrina and the shores of Cardigan
Bay.&nbsp; It was a somewhat formidable undertaking.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
mountains of Carno,&rdquo; wrote the philosophic Pennant, &ldquo;like the
mountains of Gilboa, were celebrated for the fall of the
mighty.&rdquo;&nbsp; On their steep slopes, in 1077 Gruffydd ab Cynan and
Trahaiarn ab Caradoc had wrestled for the sovereignty of North Wales.&nbsp;
Across their shoulders, some four centuries later, had marched the English
troops of Henry IV. to their camp near Machynlleth, in a vain effort to
subjugate the redoubtable Welsh chieftain, Owain Glyndwr.&nbsp; Now the
mighty heads of the mountains were, at last, to shake and submit to the
incursion of another invader, more insistent and more powerful than any
that had gone before, and a Montgomeryshire engineer and contractor were to
conquer where an English King had failed.&nbsp; In one respect only was
their experience akin.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s army had become dissolved by the
continuance of bad weather <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>which gave them all cold feet.&nbsp; The rain,
that falls alike upon the just and unjust, was to hamper Mr. David
Davies&rsquo;s army of navvies, but never to deter them from reaching and
abiding at Machynlleth.</p>
<p>In the initial stages of the new invasion all went well.&nbsp; So
rapidly were the Parliamentary preliminaries negotiated that, on July 27th,
1857, while the promoters of the neighbouring Oswestry and Newtown Railway
were still wrangling over their internecine rivalries, Royal Assent was
given to the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway Bill, authorising the Company
to raise a capital of &pound;150,000 in &pound;10 shares and loans to the
extent of &pound;50,000.&nbsp; The total length of the proposed line was
22&frac12; miles and the works were to be completed within five years.</p>
<p>A month later the first ordinary meeting of the Company was held at
Machynlleth.&nbsp; Sir Watkin presided over a most harmonious gathering, in
striking contrast to some of the meetings which had assembled further east,
and the directors in their report, read by Mr. D. Howell, who was to act as
secretary until the amalgamation of the company in the Cambrian Railways in
1864, had little to say beyond offering congratulations to the shareholders
on the speedy passing of their measure through Parliament.&nbsp; The report
seems to have been adopted without comment, and the only other business was
to appoint the board,&mdash;Earl Vane, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, Mr. R. D.
Jones, Mr. C. T. Thurston, Mr. J. Foulkes, Aberdovey, and Mr. L. Ruck. <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54" class="citation">[54]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>In
a little over twelve months from that date the Company were in a position
to begin operations.&nbsp; The contract had been let to Messrs. Davies and
Savin (Mr. Benjamin Piercy again acting as engineer), and at the end of
November, 1858, the first sod of the new link in the extended chain was
turned amidst great popular rejoicings.&nbsp; So speedy had been the
preparations that no time availed to procure a more ornamental implement,
and the Countess Vane had to use an ordinary iron shovel for the
purpose!&nbsp; A contemporary record gives the following
account:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cutting of the First Sod was very properly fixed to take
place at Machynlleth, not only out of compliment to the noble Earl and
Countess Vane, but also to increase the interest of the inhabitants of this
locality in the undertaking.&nbsp; The morning was ushered in by the bells
of the parish church ringing out most musically, the firing of cannon, and
similar demonstrations of good-will; and although in the early part of the
morning the rain fell heavily, yet towards the time fixed for the
proceedings to commence, bright Sol shone cheerfully over the beautiful
hills and valleys of Montgomeryshire, and made everything look cheerful, as
befitted the occasion.&nbsp; Two o&rsquo;clock was the time fixed for
cutting the first sod, but previously to this time a large procession was
formed at the Town Hall, and proceeded to the ground in the following
order:&mdash;</p>
<p>Band.</p>
<p>The Directors.</p>
<p>Flags and Banners.</p>
<p>The Demonstration Committee.</p>
<p>Flags and Banners.</p>

over which were the mottoes,&mdash;&lsquo;Success to the Newtown and

erected, over which was the motto&mdash;&lsquo;Peace and
Prosperity.&rsquo;&nbsp; On reaching the spot where the ceremony was
appointed to take place a large enclosure was railed out, at one end of
which was a pavilion for the accommodation of the ladies, which was well
filled.&nbsp; The parties had not long taken their allotted places before
Lady Vane came upon the ground, and was welcomed in a way that must have
been very gratifying to her, indeed it could not have been otherwise, for
it is generally admitted that a kinder-hearted lady does not exist in the
Principality, and she is most highly and deservedly popular, and well may
Earl Vane be proud of possessing such a wife.&nbsp; She was accompanied by
Lord Vane, and the young family, who appeared all thoroughly to enjoy the
occasion.&rdquo;</p>

put on a pair of gauntlets, which were presented by the Committee of
Management, proceeded to cut the first sod, which, having been deposited in
the barrow presented by Messrs. Davies and Savin, the contractors, was
wheeled to the end of the plank, after which Mrs. E. D. Jones, of Trafeign,
performed the same ceremony, and was followed by Lord Seaham, and the other
junior olive branches of the family.&nbsp; The bands played in their best
style, and the cheering was most deafening, and thus ended this portion of
the day&rsquo;s proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subsequent proceedings were of a highly convivial nature, as
befitted so auspicious an occasion.&nbsp; There was a generous imbibing of
&ldquo;a bountiful supply of Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s prime port, sherry,
etc.,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a procession of miners and quarrymen, more than 100
of whom dined at the house of Mrs. Margaret Owen, the White Lion Inn,
perhaps the most noted house in the county for the excellence of its
ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work on this line was of a rather different nature to that on which
the contractors had been engaged on the Newtown and Llanidloes, and in
bringing the Oswestry and Newtown line to completion.&nbsp; Instead of
meandering, more or less, along river-side lowlands, the track had to be
carried uphill and down-dale over the shoulder of the Montgomeryshire
highlands, ascending to an altitude of 693 feet above sea level at
Talerddig top by a climb of 273 feet from Caersws, and running down again
by a 645 feet drop to the Dovey Valley at Machynlleth.&nbsp; This involved
a gradient, at one point, of as much as 1 in 52, and, just after leaving
the summit the line had to pierce through the hillside.&nbsp; A tunnel was
originally thought of, but abandoned in favour of a cutting through solid
rock to a depth of 120 feet.&nbsp; It was while <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>excavations between the
summit and the cutting were being made that the engineers discovered a
strange geological formation, which, still observable from the train on the
left-hand side immediately after leaving Talerddig station for
Llanbrynmair, has come to be popularly known as &ldquo;the natural
arch.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work of excavating the cutting was no child&rsquo;s
play.&nbsp; But it proved a profitable part of the contract, and it seems
to have furnished not only enough stone for many of the adjacent railway
works, but, according to popular rumour, the foundation of Mr. David
Davies&rsquo;s vast fortune.&nbsp; Seeking an investment for the money he
made out of it, it is said, Mr. Davies turned his thoughts to coal and in
the rich mineral district of the Rhondda Valley it was sunk, rapidly to
fructify, and to form the basis of that great industrial organisation the
Ocean Collieries, famed throughout this country and wherever coal is used
for navigation.</p>

Magazine.&rdquo;" src="images/page58s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>For Mr. Davies was now left to finish the Newtown and Machynlleth line
alone.&nbsp; While he was obtaining stone&mdash;and gold&mdash;out of
Talerddig, his former partner, Mr. Savin, had turned his attention to
another link in the chain between the Severn and the sea.&nbsp; In the end
this arrangement, although it seems to have led to some little feeling
between the former partners, which Mr. Whalley and others did their best to
dispel, probably expedited the completion of the through connection.&nbsp;
At any rate, it did not hinder progress among the hills.&nbsp; In this, the
&ldquo;long looked-for arrival of the world-wide famed iron-horse,&rdquo;
as an expansive journalistic scribe put it, at Carno, was celebrated by
rejoicings, and a dinner given by Mr. David Davies to his foremen and a
presentation by him of a purse of &pound;50 to the &ldquo;meritorious
engine-driver, Mr. Richard Metcalfe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Toasts were honoured, and
Mr. Davies giving that of the evening, expatiated at length <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>on the virtues
of the redoubtable &ldquo;Richard.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole secret of the
speed with which the railways he had constructed had been accomplished
rested in &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s&rdquo; zeal and prowess.&nbsp; Though the
sea had covered their handiwork on the Vale of Clwyd railway half a dozen
times, &ldquo;Richard&rdquo; had stuck to his post, by day and
night&mdash;&ldquo;from two o&rsquo;clock on Monday morning till twelve
o&rsquo;clock on Saturday night, without once going to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
they had made nineteen miles of the Oswestry and Newtown track in thirteen
months it was &ldquo;in no small degree owing to
&lsquo;Richard&rsquo;s&rsquo; never-failing energy.&nbsp; He never
grumbled, but always met me with a pleasant smile.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder
that Carno shouted its three times three in &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s&rdquo;
honour and hardly less amazing that the good fellow, on rising to reply,
utterly broke down and could not complete a sentence of his carefully
prepared oration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind, &lsquo;Richard,&rsquo;&rdquo;
exclaimed Mr. David Howell, &ldquo;that is more eloquent than a
speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Carno, Metcalfe and his engine were soon to proceed to make the
acquaintance of other friends and admirers further along the line.&nbsp;
Llanbrynmair was soon to be reached, and another writer in the local Press
is moved to compare its former remoteness, &ldquo;verging close upon the
classic &lsquo;Ultima Thule&rsquo; of the first Roman,&rdquo; with the new
conditions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The railway,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with its
snorting, puffing and Vesuvian volumes of clouds, now to a certain extent
breaks upon the whilom monotony of this valley among mountains; its aptly
termed iron-horse (Mars-like, but still in a placable mood) rolls
majestically along, conveying the very backbone of creation from the
granite rock, ready trimmed, and requiring but the cunning hand of the
workman to fix the stones in their appropriate place to span the meandering
Jaen and Twymyn streams.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>One of the bridges across the Twymyn, indeed, skilfully designed
by Mr. Piercy, with whom was associated Mr. George Owen, was a notable
structure.&nbsp; It consisted of three arches, its extreme height, 70 feet
above the rushing waters of this mountain torrent, the abutments being
large blocks of Talerddig stone and the arches turned in best Ruabon
brick.&nbsp; For, continues our chronicler, it was a highly satisfactory
fact for Welsh patriots to contemplate that Mr. Davies was &ldquo;working
his line by means of Welsh materials, drawn from inexhaustible Welsh
mountains, his workmen are natives, the planning and workmanship is also
native, and he himself a thorough and spirited Welshman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less placable were some of the influences which began to exert
themselves further afield.&nbsp; The Board having set their hand to a
proposed agreement by which the Great Western Company undertook to work the
line for 40 per cent. of the gross earnings and an exchange of traffic
arrangement, it became the signal for raising again the old bogey of rival
&ldquo;interests.&rdquo;&nbsp; An anonymous writer in the &ldquo;Open
Column&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Oswestry Advertizer,&rdquo; describing the
Newtown and Machynlleth as &ldquo;the worst managed railway in the course
of formation,&rdquo; warned Machynlleth against its impending doom.&nbsp;
It would mean a break of journey at Newtown, and, to avert this, the North
Western, once the personification of all unrighteousness, was now
transformed into the fairy godmother, who, by pressing forward its
co-operation with the Bishop&rsquo;s Castle, Mid-Wales and Manchester and
Milford undertakings, was urged to carry forward connecting links from
Llanidloes over the shoulder of Plynlimmon, as a competitive route to the
sea.&nbsp; The article attracted some attention at the next meeting of the
Newtown and Machynlleth shareholders, <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>where the bargain with
the Great Western was warmly defended, both by Capt. R. D. Pryce, who
presided, and by Mr. David Davies, as the largest shareholder as well as
contractor.&nbsp; But the Oswestrian alarm was groundless.&nbsp; What
looked a rosy prospect from the Newtown and Machynlleth Company&rsquo;s
point of view, had another aspect, when it came to be more fully considered
at Paddington, and, in spite of repeated reminders, that Company failed to
take the necessary steps to secure its ratification by its shareholders,
and the working agreement for the new line was transferred to the Oswestry
and Newtown, who were already working the Newtown and Llanidloes
Railway.&nbsp; The incipient Cambrian, in fact, willy nilly, was now
beginning to experience the sensation which comes, sooner or later, to
healthily expanding youth, when it has to stand alone.&nbsp; Tumbles there
might be ahead, but the day of leading strings was finally left behind.</p>
<p>Two engines &ldquo;of a powerful class&rdquo; with 4ft. 6in. wheels,
capable of hauling 140 ton loads up 1/52 gradients at 15 miles an hour,
accelerated to 25 miles on the easier levels had been quoted for by Messrs.
Sharp, Stewart and Co., of the Atlas Works, Manchester, in 1861, at the
cost of &pound;2,445 each, and by the end of 1862 the Company were fully
equipped to cope with the traffic of the district.</p>
<p>At the end of the first week of the new year (1863) the opening ceremony
took place.&nbsp; The engines, &ldquo;Countess Vane&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Talerddig,&rdquo; drew a train of 1,500 passengers, who had marched
in procession to the Machynlleth Station, up the long incline, over the
Talerddig summit and down to Newtown and back.&nbsp; At the intermediate
stations, Cemmes Road, Llanbrynmair, Carno, Pontdolgoch and Caersws, it was
hailed with vociferous applause as it sped on its way, <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and as Newtown was
approached the travellers found themselves passing under triumphal arches,
to the clang of church bells and the blare of bands.&nbsp; On the leading
engine rode the young Marquis of Blandford playing &ldquo;See the
Conquering Here Comes&rdquo; on the cornet-a-piston, Mr. George Owen, Mr.
Davies and Mr. Webb.&nbsp; Earl Vane was in the train and received a public
welcome at the station.&nbsp; Then the inevitable speeches.&nbsp; The
return train was still longer and took two hours to reach Machynlleth,
where the jubilations were renewed, and Countess Vane, to whom Mr. Davies
presented a silver spade in honour of the previous ceremony of sod cutting,
declared the line open.&nbsp; More speeches, luncheon, toasts and
processioning <i>ab lib</i> and &ldquo;so home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time, however, had come for a memorable parting.&nbsp; From the
consummation of this project Mr. David Davies&rsquo;s connection with the
Cambrian, as one of its contractors, was to cease.&nbsp; He had saved it
from early death, and guided the infant through its difficult teething
time, while at the same time he was employed in building other railways,
which, later, were to become closely linked with its fuller life.&nbsp;
Among these was the Mid-Wales, to become amalgamated with the Cambrian in
1904, the Brecon and Merthyr, over four miles of whose metals, from
Talyllyn Junction to Brecon, Cambrian trains were from that date to run,
and the Manchester and Milford, which formed a junction with the Cambrian
at Aberystwyth.&nbsp; But so far as the Cambrian itself is concerned Mr.
Davies&rsquo;s future association was to be that of a director, an office,
in its turn, dramatically terminated amidst fresh thunder clouds which had
not yet appeared above the horizon.</p>
<h3><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>II.</h3>
<p>Mr. Savin, as we have seen, had, during these later stages of progress
with the making of the line from Newtown, been busily engaged still nearer
the coast.&nbsp; A company with an ambitious name and a not less ambitious
aim had been formed to build a railway from Aberystwyth to Machynlleth and
along the shores of Merionethshire to Portmadoc, the port of shipment of
the Festiniog slate traffic, and eventually to continue, through Pwllheli
to that wonderful prospective harbour, upon which the eyes of railway
promoters had already been turned without avail, Porthdynlleyn, near Nevin.
<a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; Its close connection with the other local
undertakings is shown by the agreement under which the Oswestry and Newtown
was to subscribe &pound;75,000, and the Newtown and Llanidloes
&pound;25,000 by the creation of 5 per cent. preference stock, a sum
ultimately increased in the case of the former Company by another
&pound;100,000.</p>
<p>Borne on the wings of Mr. Whalley&rsquo;s eloquence, Aberystwyth,
assembled in public meeting, led by the Mayor, Mr. Robert Edwards, gave its
enthusiastic support to the scheme.&nbsp; This was followed by another
meeting, at which Mr. Piercy, as engineer, outlined the plan and bade the
inhabitants look forward to the day when the railway was to enable them to
compete with successful rivals on the North Wales Coast, and once more
justify for them <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the proud name of &ldquo;the Brighton of
Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other railway companies were inclined to be
obstructive, but their opposition was not altogether formidable, and when
Mr. Abraham Howell appeared in the role of mediator between conflicting
interests, the way was soon prepared for proceeding apace with the
scheme.&nbsp; So harmonious, indeed, had the atmosphere become that within
less than two months of this meeting the Company&rsquo;s Bill had received
Royal Assent, almost a record, surely, in those days of interminable
controversy!&nbsp; Mr. Savin&rsquo;s project was to begin by carrying the
line, whence it linked up with the Newtown and Machynlleth at the latter
place, as far as Ynyslas.&nbsp; Here, at the nearest point on the seaboard,
the mists which hang over the great bogs that stretch from the sand-dunes
up to the foothills of Plynlimmon, took fantastic shape in the eye of the
ambitious contractor.&nbsp; He may, perchance, have heard the story told of
a man who owned a barren piece of land bordering the seashore.&nbsp; A
friend advised him to convert it to some use.&nbsp; The owner replied that
it would not grow grass, or produce corn, was unfit for fruit trees, and
could not even be converted into an ornamental lake as the soil was too
sandy to retain the water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the friend,
&ldquo;why not make it a first-class watering place?&rdquo;&nbsp; This, at
any rate, was the project on which Mr. Savin set his heart.&nbsp; But not
even first-class watering places can be built in a day, and the contractor
made a modest beginning with a row of lodging houses.&nbsp; Alas! not for
the last time, the parable of the man who built upon the sands was to have
its application to these Welsh coast undertakings.&nbsp; The houses were no
sooner finished than they began to sink, and some time later they were
pulled down and the material put to more hopeful and profitable use.</p>

<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Ynyslas remains to-day a lonely swamp, but somewhat better luck
attended the effort to carry the excursionist on to Borth.&nbsp; The line
was pushed on there, and an old farm house, on the outskirts of what was
then nothing but a tiny fishing village, was converted into a
station.&nbsp; The following July the line was open for traffic.&nbsp;
Curiously enough, little public interest seems to have been aroused in
Borth itself by the event.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the village were mainly
engaged in seafaring, and the arrival of the steam engine, in the opinion
of some, boded no good.&nbsp; As for English visitors&mdash;what use were
they?&nbsp; The story, indeed, is told that some four enterprising
tourists, who had arrived ahead of the railway, sought accommodation in
vain in the village, and had perforce to make the best of it in a
contractor&rsquo;s railway wagon that stood on a siding of the unfinished
line.&nbsp; They cuddled up under a tarpaulin sheet and settled down for
the night, when someone gave the wagon a shove and starting down an incline
on the unballasted track it proceeded merrily on its way to Ynyslas.&nbsp;
Not so merry the affrighted and unwilling passengers, who, when day broke,
discovered themselves marooned in a remote spot miles from anywhere
productive of breakfast bacon and eggs!</p>
<p>But, if Borth itself looked on askance, Aberystwyth was ready enough to
acclaim the approach of the railway.&nbsp; The resort on the Rheidol had
already begun to attract visitors who completed the journey from Llanidloes
or Machynlleth by coach, and now there was the prospect, in the early
future, of the railway running into the town itself.&nbsp; So, very early
on the day when the first train was to steam into and out of Borth,
vehicles of all sorts crowded the road from Aberystwyth, the narrow street
of Borth was rapidly thronged with an excited multitude who flowed over on
the sands.&nbsp; <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>At 8-30 a.m. the train left, with 100
excursionists.&nbsp; It was followed by another at 1 p.m., for which 530
took tickets.&nbsp; There was a great scramble for seats, and every one of
the thirty coaches of which the train was composed, was packed to the
doors.&nbsp; Those who failed to obtain a footing formed an avenue a mile
long through which the train moved out amidst tumultuous applause.&nbsp; In
the carriages the passengers shouted, talked, ate, drank and&mdash;sang
hymns!&nbsp; The twelve miles to Machynlleth took about twenty-five minutes
to accomplish, and, arrived there, the excursionists enjoyed themselves
immensely, &ldquo;as,&rdquo; says a contemporary recorder,
&ldquo;Aberystwyth people generally manage to do when from home at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor were the good folks of Aberystwyth peculiar in their joy.&nbsp; A
Shropshire newspaper published a leading article of a column and a half
descriptive of &ldquo;six hours by the seaside for
half-a-crown,&rdquo;&mdash;the return excursion fare from Shrewsbury and
Oswestry, while Poolonians could travel for a florin.&nbsp; The result was
a mighty rush of trippers, not the less attracted, possibly, by the
additional announcement that the railway company had thoughtfully opened a
refreshment room at Borth station!&nbsp; So great, indeed, was the press of
traffic, that the company&rsquo;s servants sometimes had considerable
difficulty in coping with it.&nbsp; One day all the tickets were exhausted,
but the stationmaster at Carno, one Burke, an Irishman, not to be beaten,
booked some thirty or forty farm labourers with &ldquo;cattle
tickets.&rdquo;&nbsp; The manager passed next day and remonstrated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, Burke,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the men won&rsquo;t like your
making beasts of them!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Och, yure honour,&rdquo;
returned the stationmaster, &ldquo;many of them made bastes of themselves
before they returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the scenes at Borth on the arrival of these excursions were
occasionally almost indescribable.&nbsp; One scribe invokes <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>the loan of the
pencil of Hogarth adequately to portray it.&nbsp; &ldquo;From a cover of
stones close by springs an urchin lithe and swift; another and another,
ten, twelve or more, &lsquo;naked as unto earth they came,&rsquo; and away
in single file across the beach into the sea.&nbsp; The vans move
ponderously on, pushed by mermen and mermaids, and out spring any quantity
of live Hercules.&nbsp; Very curious must be the sight, if one might judge
by the crowds of ladies&mdash;well women at any rate&mdash;and gentlemen
around every group of bathers.&nbsp; Boats are in great request and the
ladies cling very lovingly to the boatmen who, in return, hug them tightly
as they embark or disembark their fair freight.&nbsp; The very porpoises,
gambling out there, seem to enjoy the whole thing heartily and shake their
fat sides at the fun.&nbsp; Our friend with the hammer discourses learnedly
about those long ridges of hard rock which stand out over the Dovey Plain
when, gracious me! we look round and, will you believe it?&nbsp; There was
a bevy of females in a state of&mdash;shall I go on?&nbsp; No; but I will
just say we saw them waddling like ducks into the water.&nbsp; The
porpoises were alarmed and betook themselves off.&nbsp; And so did
we.&nbsp; Had the bathers been black instead of white we should have
thought ourselves on the coast of Africa.&nbsp; Such an Adam and Eve-ish
state of things we never saw before.&nbsp; Well, <i>honi soit qui mal y
pense</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyhow, thus did the six hours swiftly pass in those unregenerate
days.&nbsp; For Mr. Savin had yet to build his Borth hotel and lodging
houses, which to-day give welcome shelter to a very different throng of
visitors, summer after summer, attracted by the placid beauties and the
invigorating air of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; It was, at worst, but a temporary
orgy, marking, as it were, a new epoch in the life of the Cambrian; whose
lengthening limbs now stretched from the Severn to the sea.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; THE BATTLE OF ELLESMERE.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The question of a railway is now or
never</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Late Mr. R. G. Jebb</span>,
of Ellesmere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No period, since the wild days of the &ldquo;railway mania,&rdquo; was
more pregnant of schemes than the later months of 1860.&nbsp; They sprang
up like mushrooms all along the Shropshire border, and some of them, like
mushrooms, as suddenly suffered decay.&nbsp; A facetious Salopian prophet
ventured publicly to predict that &ldquo;we shall hear next of a railway to
Llansilin (a remote village among the border hills) or the
moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; His ratiocination was hardly exaggerated.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;preliminary prospectus&rdquo; was actually published for carrying a
railway, at a cost of under &pound;10,000 per mile, from Shrewsbury,
through Kinnerley and Porthywaen, thence &ldquo;near Llanfyllin and
Llanrhaiadr,&rdquo; to Llangynog, &ldquo;through the Berwyn hills&rdquo; to
Llandrillo, and so to Dolgelley and Portmadoc.&nbsp; It was to be worked
and maintained by the West Midland, Shrewsbury and Coast of Wales Railway
Co.; the prospects of mineral and passenger traffic were &ldquo;most
promising,&rdquo; and throughout its entire length of 90 miles, the
promoters pointed out with all the emphasis which italics can afford,
&ldquo;it has <i>only one tunnel</i>, and that slightly exceeding a mile
and half in length.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eventually, a line, partly following this
<!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>route, under the less comprehensive title of the West Shropshire
Mineral Railway, and later known as &ldquo;the Potteries,&rdquo;
constructed from a station in Abbey Forgate, Shrewsbury, to Llanymynech,
and on to Nantmawr, with a branch from Kinnerley to Criggion, ran for a
time, then fell into abeyance and disrepair, and was in recent years
re-opened under the Light Railways Act as the Shropshire and
Montgomeryshire Railway, an independent company.</p>
<p>But, in its original form, the undertaking was apparently to be no
friendly competitor with the existing Oswestry and Newtown and associated
lines, whose ambition it had, for some time, been to extend its northern
terminus, resting on the Great Western branch at Oswestry, through
Ellesmere to Whitchurch, there to form a more serviceable junction with the
London and North Western from Shrewsbury to Crewe, and the busy hives of
Lancashire.&nbsp; But more formidable opposition was already afoot
elsewhere.&nbsp; The Great Western, none too eager, as we have seen, to
assist independent undertakings in Montgomeryshire, were ready enough to
capture traffic in other quarters, and their answer to the Oswestry and
Whitchurch project was to formulate a scheme for a branch from Rednal to
Ellesmere, with incidental hints about constructing a loop to place
Oswestry on their main line.&nbsp; Draughtsmen were busy everywhere with
pens and plans.&nbsp; Public halls echoed to the optimistic eloquence of
promoters and counter promoters, and powder and shot was being hurriedly
got together for the tremendous fusilade in the Parliamentary committee
rooms, where, for many a long day, there was to rage and sway the battle
for the rights and privileges of bringing the steam engine into the little
town of Ellesmere.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>For, though wider schemes were involved in the struggle, Ellesmere
was the pivot on which arguments and contentions centred.&nbsp; In such a
conflict, needless to say, all the old rivalries of &ldquo;leviathan&rdquo;
interests, of which we have already heard so much, re-emerged.&nbsp; What
was still called the &ldquo;Montgomeryshire party&rdquo;&mdash;the men who
had brought the other local railways into existence in spite of well-nigh
overwhelming difficulties&mdash;continued to look for association with the
North Western for greater salvation.&nbsp; Others favoured the chance of
obtaining increased facilities for through traffic from the Great
Western.&nbsp; Between the two warring elements, Ellesmere itself, as one
of its most estimable and influential citizens had put it, believed it was
&ldquo;now or never&rdquo; for them.&nbsp; In the Parliamentary Committee
Rooms, where the evidence occupied thirteen days, and counsels&rsquo;
speeches several more, the two projects were stubbornly fought out.&nbsp;
Great Western witnesses came forward to aver that, owing to the haste with
which the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway had been projected, Oswestry had
been left too much in the lurch, and the time was now come for
reconsideration of its claims to be brought on to the main line.&nbsp; Mr.
Sergeant Wheeler, with all the command of forensic eloquence, drew visions
of the Shropshire market town as &ldquo;a great central place of meeting
for the people all round.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that was necessary was to build
a line from Oswestry to Rednal, and then the projected branch from Rednal
to Ellesmere, and Rednal itself might become a second Rugby or Crewe; who
could tell?&nbsp; As to the continuation of such a line from Ellesmere to
Whitchurch, true, Paddington was not enthusiastic, but when they found that
that was the price demanded for any measure of local support, they were
ready to pay it.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>In
Oswestry there was, naturally enough, a general approval of any step which
would place the town on the Great Western main line, and no small point was
made of the fact that it would be better to have one station than
two.&nbsp; Moreover, Mr. R. J. Croxon. whose words were weighted with the
influence of a family solicitor, private banker and town clerk, was of
opinion that, apart from anything else, to carry a line, as Mr. Whalley
proposed, for two miles by the side of the turnpike to Whittington would be
&ldquo;very dangerous to people driving along,&rdquo; and the attention of
the Trustees ought to be called to it.&nbsp; But, unfortunately for Mr.
Croxon and those who shared his fears in this regard, it was the business
of the local surveyor to examine the plans, and he was &ldquo;engaged on
the other side.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus even among Oswestrians was opinion
divided between the rival routes, and men like Alderman Thomas Minshall and
Alderman Peploe Cartwright, who had stood shoulder to shoulder in the fight
for independent interests in the making of the Oswestry and Newtown
Railway, were now inclined to regard each others&rsquo; sympathies with
some suspicion.</p>
<p>Further down the proposed line the weight was thrown rather more
decisively in favour of the Whalley scheme.&nbsp; Whitchurch had petitioned
against the Great Western proposals, though Captain Cust, who gave evidence
for the larger company, was moved to dismiss this effort as the work of
&ldquo;Captain Clement Hill and lot of ragamuffins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Attempts
were even made to disparage the local undertaking by reference to Mr.
Savin, who had agreed to carry out the line on similar terms of lease
already adopted elsewhere, as a &ldquo;haberdasher, not in a position to
subscribe millions towards railway projects.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Ellesmere the
argument that the Great Western scheme would bring the agricultural area
into close touch with the <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>North Wales coalfields was quickly answered by
the counter-plea that the independent company could also build a branch
from that spot to Ruabon or Wrexham, and powers to that effect &ldquo;would
be applied for as soon as what may be called the main line from Oswestry to
Whitchurch was carried.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the larger landowners through
whose estates the rival engineers had marched with their instruments
differed in their point of approach.&nbsp; Sir John Kynaston, Bart., of
Hardwicke, near Ellesmere, who, as someone said, &ldquo;if he had been left
alone, was willing, like Marcus Curtius, to sacrifice himself for the
public good, was brought and instructed to give evidence about
embankments,&rdquo; one of which, on Mr. Whalley&rsquo;s line, by the way,
it was supposed (though in error) would shut out his view of the Vale of
Llangollen, and &ldquo;destroy the happiness of his existence for the
remainder of his days.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir John Hanmer, Bart., M.P., on the
other hand, was inclined to become rhapsodic.&nbsp; He looked upon a
railway &ldquo;as a fine work of art,&rdquo; which any painter might be
glad to include in his landscape&mdash;only, of course, it must not cut off
a landed proprietor from his woods and his other wild grounds, as the Great
Western scheme proposed to do, and against this he not only objected but
petitioned.</p>

<p>In the end the Committee declared the preamble of the Montgomeryshire
party, for their Oswestry, Ellesmere, and Whitchurch Railway to be proved,
and that of the Great Western not proved, though the Chairman regretted to
add that the finding was not unanimous.&nbsp; In the lobbies rumour had it
that it was, in fact, only arrived at by the casting vote of that gentleman
himself.&nbsp; Be that as it may, it sufficed.&nbsp; Once again
&ldquo;independent&rdquo; effort, astutely engineered, had triumphed over
the all-powerful interests of a great and wealthy company, and amongst
those who had hoped and <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>feared and hoped again for the success of the
Oswestry Ellesmere and Whitchurch scheme enthusiasm knew no bounds.</p>
<p>In Ellesmere a great and excited crowd awaited news from London at the
Bridgewater Hotel.&nbsp; They watched for the omnibus from Gobowen, which
it was expected might bear the fateful tidings.&nbsp; But either the
omnibus failed to arrive, or, if it did, it had no intelligence to
impart.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, however, a special messenger came post
haste along the road from Oswestry, and in a moment the news flashed
through the little town.&nbsp; &ldquo;Victory&rdquo;!&nbsp; An attempt was
made to ring the bells, but the churchwarden could not be found, and no one
else had authority to pull the ropes.&nbsp; So that the concourse fell back
on the time-honoured procession, and led by a drum and fife band, and
headed by the Bailiffs, the cheering throng paraded the streets while
cannon booming from the market place startled the countryside for a mile or
more around.&nbsp; Oswestry, assembled in public meeting, put to flight its
town clerk&rsquo;s gloomy prognostications with hilarious speeches, and
outside the more dignified civic circles popular demonstration took still
more picturesque form.</p>
<p>The return of a number of witnesses who had gone up to London to give
evidence against the local scheme and in support of the Great Western was
awaited at the Oswestry station by a hostile crowd.&nbsp; Some delay in
their arrival home was occasioned by an untoward incident even before they
finally left London.&nbsp; Seating themselves in a first-class compartment
in the rear of the train at Paddington, they waited at first patiently and
then impatiently for it to start.&nbsp; At last, unable to understand the
delay, one of them put out his head and asked a passing official when the
train was going.&nbsp; &ldquo;It <i>has</i> gone&rdquo; was the laconic
reply.&nbsp; The coach <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>which they had chosen was not attached to the
rest of the train, and they were not so meticulously careful about
examining tickets on the Great Western system as they are to-day.&nbsp;
When the belated passengers did eventually reach Oswestry, the crowd was
still there.&nbsp; What was more, they had had time to organise what was
deemed a suitable reception.&nbsp; Among the witnesses was a gentleman who,
it appeared, had at one time been very short of pence, and, it was alleged,
had left his abode without paying the rent.&nbsp; Somehow or another this
little fact had been raked up and a number of wags had cut the shape of a
latch-key out of a sheet of tin.&nbsp; As he alighted from the train this
was dangled before him at the end of a long pole, with a pendant
inscription, &ldquo;Who left the key under the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promoters of the new undertaking, of which Mr. George Lewis became
first secretary, with offices in Oswald Chambers, Oswestry, had every
reason for satisfaction.&nbsp; Royal assent was given to their Bill in
August, 1861, authorising a capital of &pound;150,000 in &pound;10 shares,
with &pound;50,000 on loan, the work to be completed within five
years.&nbsp; There were, however, still tough battles to be waged over
subsequent efforts to obtain sanction for certain deviations and
extensions, against which the Great Western continued to fight tooth and
nail with a counter-offensive of their own.&nbsp; No fewer than three
distinct schemes were now before the public, with all sorts of loops and
junctions at Rednal or Mile End, near Whittington, and branches from
Bettisfield to Wem, or to Yorton, and from Ellesmere to Ruabon.&nbsp; But
it is an easier task to draw plans on a map than to carry them out.&nbsp;
The Wem branch never matured, the link with Denbighshire only after many
years, and then to Wrexham and not Ruabon.&nbsp; So far as the main issue
was concerned, however, the Great Western again failed <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to prove their
preamble, and another signal was given for local rejoicings over the
result.&nbsp; Not only at Oswestry and Ellesmere and other places along the
route of the new line, but as far afield as Montgomery and Llanfyllin,
where a branch line of their own was being promoted to Llanymynech, hats
were thrown into the air and healths were drunk to the victory for local
enterprise.&nbsp; Oswestry parish church bells rang for two days, and the
Rifle Corps band blew itself dry outside the houses of Mr. Savin, Mr.
George Owen and others.&nbsp; Mr. Savin himself, returning from London,
during these proceedings, met &ldquo;with a reception at Oswestry such as
no man ever received before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carried shoulder high through the
streets of the town, accompanied by a surging throng of cheering admirers,
armed with torches, to the tune of &ldquo;See the Conquering Hero
comes,&rdquo; he was addressed in congratulatory vein by several of his
fellow-citizens, and it was only when a first and second attempt to fly
from the embarrassment of so tumultuous a welcome had failed, that he
succeeded, on a third, in making his escape.&nbsp; The &ldquo;small
haberdasher,&rdquo; who had been deemed incapable of organising railway
schemes, had indeed become something very like a railway king!</p>
<p>But we are anticipating events.&nbsp; At the end of August, 1861, the
first sod had been cut at Ellesmere, where it was proposed to begin the
construction, proceeding first in the direction of Whitchurch.&nbsp; The
ceremony was performed by Sir John Hanmer and Mr. John Stanton, in a field
belonging to Mr. W. A. Provis, &ldquo;not far from the workhouse,&rdquo;
and a spade and barrow, suitably inscribed, was presented to Sir John by
Messrs. Savin and Ward, the contractors.&nbsp; There was the usual
ceremonial, inclusive of banqueting and speech-making, and banners,
emblazoned with such appropriate mottoes as &ldquo;Whalley for ever,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hurrah for Sir John Hanmer and <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>John Stanton,
Esquire,&rdquo; floated in the breeze.&nbsp; One ingenious gentleman,
elaborating the topical theme, had erected a flag which, we are told,
&ldquo;attracted special attention from its significance and
quaintness,&rdquo; representing a donkey cart with two passengers on one
side and a steam engine and carriages on the other, to personify
&ldquo;Ellesmere of yesterday,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ellesmere of
to-day,&rdquo; with the philosophic addendum, &ldquo;Evil communications
corrupt good manners,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, says the preacher, every valley
shall be raised and every hill shall be brought low.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Aye, says the teacher, let us bless the bridge that carries us
safely over,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, aye, quoth honest nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
application to evil communications might, in such a connection, be a little
ambiguous, but presumably nobody imagined it to refer to the Oswestry,
Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway!</p>
<p>The allusion to bridges was rather more germane; for, in building the
line towards Whitchurch, which was the first section taken in hand, the
engineers were faced with a bridging problem of a peculiar nature, and only
less in magnitude than that which had confronted the constructors of the
famous Liverpool and Manchester Railway thirty years earlier.&nbsp; Partly
in order to avoid interfering with Sir John Hanmer&rsquo;s property, and
partly because they deemed it the better way, the engineers decided to
carry the line over Whixall Moss, a wide area of bog land lying between
Bettisfield and Fenns Bank.&nbsp; This, it was supposed, might even be
drained by making the railway across its quivering surface, but hopes of
this sort were not to be realised, for it remains to-day a wild, but
picturesque stretch of heather and silver birches, where the peat-digger
plies his trade with, perhaps, as much profit as the farmer would in
tilling it.&nbsp; But as to its power to bear the weight of passing trains
the engineers had little doubt.&nbsp; <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>The canal already
crossed it, and though in making soundings the surveyors once lost their 35
foot rod in the morass, this, was near the canal bank, and it did not deter
them in their efforts to discover a means of securing the railway from
similar disaster.&nbsp; The average depth of the moss was found to be
twelve feet, but there were areas where it was only nine feet deep, and at
most 17 feet, and when the bottom was reached it was discovered to be
sand.</p>
<p>So, proceeding merrily, Mr. George Owen first drained the site of the
line by means of deep side and lateral drains filled with brushwood and
grig.&nbsp; He then laid strong faggots three feet thick and from eight to
twelve feet long, and over these placed a framework of larch poles
extending the entire width of the rails.&nbsp; The poles were then
interlaced with branches of hazel and brushwood and upon this the sleepers
and rails were laid, the whole being ballasted with sand and other light
material.&nbsp; And, in the end it proved a triumph for courage and
ingenuity.&nbsp; Though there might be some slight oscillation, heavy
trains have been running over this interesting two or three mile stretch
for many a long year without the slightest mishap.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by little Ellesmere, another &ldquo;first sod&rdquo;
was turned at Oswestry on September 4th, 1862, by Miss Kinchant of Park
Hall, and Miss Lloyd, daughter of the Mayor of the borough, on the Shelf
Bank field, hard by the existing terminus of the Oswestry and Newtown
Railway, with which the new line was to be connected.&nbsp; The streets
were in gala dress, and while the leading citizens fared sumptuously on the
Wynnstay Arms bowling green, and disported themselves at a &ldquo;rural
f&ecirc;te,&rdquo; tea was served to &ldquo;the poorer women of the town
and neighbourhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition to the residents many came from
Ellesmere in wagons drawn by a decorated <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>traction
engine,&mdash;significant emblem of the new power which was shortly to
bring the two neighbouring and ever friendly places within a quarter of an
hour&rsquo;s distance of each other.</p>
<p>Work now went ahead on both sections of the line, under the personal
supervision of Messrs. Thomas and John Savin and Mr. John Ward, and by the
spring of 1863 the railway was ready for traffic over the eleven miles
between Ellesmere and Whitchurch.&nbsp; The honour of being the first
passengers to make the journey belongs, appropriately enough, to the late
Capt. Jebb and his company of Rifles, who, by courtesy of the contractors,
were driven to Whitchurch on April 20th, a few other friends accompanying
them.&nbsp; The official trial trip was made shortly after, in a train
drawn by &ldquo;two heavy engines,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Montgomery&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Hero,&rdquo; and in crossing Whixall Moss, we are told,
&ldquo;the deflection was almost inappreciable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Tyler
was now able to pass the line as entirely satisfactory, and, early in the
morning on the first Monday in May, a little group of Ellesmerians
assembled at their new station to witness the first regular train leave for
Whitchurch.&nbsp; No doubt their hearts swelled with pride, but beyond the
usual exhibition of such emotion as so notable an event inspired, there was
no public acclaim.</p>
<p>Another twelve months were to elapse before the remaining section, from
Ellesmere to Oswestry, was ready for traffic.&nbsp; In July 1864, however,
this link was forged, and the event synchronizing with the completion of
the work at the other end of the chain, from Borth to Aberystwyth, it threw
open the whole length of what was about to become, under the Consolidation
Act, the main line of the Cambrian Railways.</p>

maritime events of the reign of Canute</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Edward, Third Earl of Powis</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No Chapter in the story of the Cambrian is more intimately touched with
the spirit of romance, none more prolific of pathetic humour, than that
which concerns what is to-day termed the Coast Section.&nbsp; For the
moment, however, all was sunshine and success.&nbsp; The continuation of
the line from Borth to Aberystwyth was completed for traffic, as we have
just seen, in the summer of 1864, and on that auspicious day when trains
began to run through from Whitchurch to the new terminus on the banks of
the Rheidol the rejoicings in Aberystwyth were such as to eclipse even
those who had marked earlier stages of the construction of the various
railways now linked in one long chain.&nbsp; Indeed, the triumphal
procession which made its way to the coast was bent on more than one
celebration.&nbsp; The day was also to mark the opening of the hotel which
Mr. Savin had built at Borth, and when the train finally arrived at
Aberystwyth at a quarter past three it was accorded a civic welcome; the
Mayor, Mr. Morgan, <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and Corporation tendering to Messrs. Thomas and
John Savin an address, in which thanks were poured out upon these
&ldquo;benefactors&rdquo; to the locality.&nbsp; A move was then made to
the promenade, where Mrs. Edwards drove the first pile in the new pier,
and, after much processioning, the great assembly sat down at the Belle Vue
Hotel for a banquet of which, surely, the like has never been seen in the
town since!&nbsp; Here his Worship, supported by Earl Vane, Capt. E. L.
Pryse, M.P., Mr. Thomas Barnes, M.P., Capt. R. D. Pryce, the Contractors,
Engineers, and many other ardent workers for or well-wishers of the
undertaking, presided over a flow of oratory, the report of which occupied
over five columns of the newspapers, and visions of a new Aberystwyth swam
before the eyes of the guests, wonderful and beatific!&nbsp; Such, indeed,
was the sumptuousness of the repast, and the wealth of oratory, that it was
eleven at night before the company could be persuaded to take their places
in the return train, and at three o&rsquo;clock the next morning a jovial
party arrived home at Oswestry, tired and sleepy, though happy and
glorious.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;Crimean campaign&rdquo; of girdling the coast of
Merionethshire and penetrating onward to the distant peninsula of Lleyn,
which was part of the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast scheme, was yet only in
its earlier stages, and already the difficulties of the undertaking had had
their sobering effects.&nbsp; The original idea of Mr. Piercy was to build
a huge bridge from Ynyslas across the estuary of the Dovey to Aberdovey,
whence it was proposed to run a service of steam boats to Ireland.&nbsp;
Work was begun with seeking a foundation in the shifting sands.&nbsp; Men
were engaged with the boring rods, but they could only labour at low tide,
and in the long intervals when the water was high, adjacent hostelries
afforded <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>a too attractive method of spending enforced leisure, so that
often, it is said, when the waters had receded enough to renew operations,
some of the borers were too bemused to know whether they were on the solid
earth or not.&nbsp; At any rate, no sure foundation could be found, either
by Philip drunk or by Philip sober, and it was reluctantly concluded that
another means of bridging the gulf must be sought.</p>
<p>Adopting the wise Tennysonian counsel, the promoters eventually decided
to &ldquo;take the bend,&rdquo; and Parliamentary power was sought for this
deviation of the original scheme.&nbsp; It was opposed by the Great Western
Railway as inimical to their project of carrying a line from Bala to
Barmouth and so forming a connection with the Welsh Coast, and their
antagonism was only disposed of after a compromise had been made in the
Parliamentary Committee Room, by which the great company obtained power to
build the bridge themselves, if they wished, within ten years, and the
tolls on the deviation were to be charged only for the same distance as if
the traffic had been carried by the bridge.&nbsp; So the line was carried
round to cross the Dovey at a narrow point near Glandyfi and connect the
coast line with the other railway there.</p>
<p>Hence the existence of, perhaps, the most beautifully situated of all
railway stations, formerly called Glandovey Junction, but changed in recent
years to Dovey Junction to avoid confusion with the adjacent Glandovey
station, at the same time transformed into Glandyfi.&nbsp; Being only
intended for changing trains the station is peculiar in having no exit, and
the very few passengers who ever alight here for other purposes than
entering another train have, presumably to make their way as best they can
along the line.&nbsp; Another feature of this station is that its buildings
and adjuncts <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>lie in three counties.&nbsp; The station itself is in
Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; The stationmaster&rsquo;s house, just over the river
bridge is in Merioneth, and from the signalbox the signalman works an up
distant signal which is planted in the soil of Cardiganshire!</p>
<p>But this connection only came later, in August 1867, when the six miles
of line from Aberdovey to the Junction was carried along the estuary shore
and through the four tunnels which, until the Mid-Wales Railway was
absorbed in 1904, remained the only ones on the whole system.&nbsp; For a
considerable time after the coast line was opened passengers were carried
from Aberdovey by ferry to Ynyslas.&nbsp; At high tide the boat could make
for the station, but when the water was low it berthed on the Cardiganshire
side, at a lower landing place, whence travellers and baggage proceeded by
a little branch into Ynyslas station.</p>
<p>The first sod on the Merionethshire side had been cut, in April 1862, by
Mrs. Foulkes of Aberdovey, on the Green near the Corbett Arms Hotel at
Towyn, without formal ceremony, but in the presence of Mr. Piercy and Mr.
Savin, and &ldquo;a few scores of persons who cheered lustily.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We may hope that even this mild demonstration did something to hearten the
promoters in their herculean task.&nbsp; For several miles along the shore
the line had to be protected against the assault of the high tides that
periodically sweep Cardigan Bay, and it was soon only too evident that
ordinary ramparts were no sure buttress against Atlantic rollers.&nbsp;
More than once the permanent way was washed by the waves and engineer and
contractor, viewing the dismal wreckage, must have felt that noble
references to the moral of Canute, however pungent, were not altogether
inapropos.</p>
<p>There were toilers at this work, however, who had never heard of the
Danish King and bode not of what the maritime <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>history of England
might teach.&nbsp; To them the arrival of the first trial train on the
banks of the Dysynni was more pertinently an occasion for
&ldquo;celebration,&rdquo; and sixty pounds being quickly collected for the
purpose, and as quickly spent, rumour has it that, alas! the festivities
ended for some in a few reflective hours, we may hope profitably, if not
too comfortably, spent in the local lock-up.</p>
<p>But even when the Dysynni had been safely bridged,&mdash;not without
anxious days when piles refused to become embedded in the shingly bed of
the river&mdash;the troubles of the constructors were far from
concluded.&nbsp; Beyond Llwyngwril, to which the line was opened for
traffic in November, 1863,&mdash;the engines and coaches had been brought
by barge across the Dovey from Ynyslas&mdash;there lay a still more
formidable barrier to rapid progress.&nbsp; For the cliffs hereabouts,
which, with their steep declivity down to the rock-strewn shore, left
scarcely a foothold for the wandering mountain sheep, were enough to daunt
the heart of any but the most courageous and determined engineer.&nbsp;
Here, again, the problem rose as to whether they should be tunnelled or the
line carried along their sloping edge, supported by sea-walls, as was the
high road above.&nbsp; But the high road itself shaved the edge of the
precipice so closely that, it is related, in the old coaching days, many
people preferred leaving the vehicle at the top of the hill to swinging
down such a slope.&nbsp; Eventually choice fell on the latter alternative,
sailors being employed to assist in the work by reason of their greater
experience on such seagirt ledges!&nbsp; It was, indeed, a hazardous
venture; for the extreme narrowness of the ground to work upon, sometimes
tapering away to practically no ground at all, hampered the task at every
step, and the difficulty of building a track along which heavy trains could
run at high speed was never quite surmounted.&nbsp; Even to-day <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>trains
descending the 1 in 60 decline are carefully regulated in speed, no bad
arrangement, after all, since this stretch of line commands, on a clear
day, one of the finest peeps of the whole charming panorama of scenery
along the coast of North Wales.</p>
<p>But engineer and contractor had something better to do than admire the
view.&nbsp; Below them and beyond, even when Barmouth Junction was reached
in July, 1865, there lay another obstacle which could not be avoided by any
but the widest detour.&nbsp; Trains could, and were eventually carried
around the narrow neck of the Dovey; they must cross the estuary of the
Mawddach almost at its widest point in order to gain the Barmouth
shore.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the line was carried along the southern bank of the
river, by what is now the Dolgelley branch, to Penmaenpool, and the public
had to remain content with such facilities as this localised service could
provide.</p>
<p>And a wonderful service it appears to have been!&nbsp; Old inhabitants
still tell tales of how goods trains would pull up at remote wayside spots
while driver and guard went trapping hares that made good prices in the
neighbouring markets, where no inconvenient questions were asked concerning
their capture.&nbsp; Or it might be that, now and again, a waggon load of
beer barrels was consigned to some village inn.&nbsp; It was then the
business of those in charge so to marshal the train that the
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; was placed in convenient proximity to the engine, and,
in the seclusion of some cutting, a halt would be made for some mysterious
reason.&nbsp; To clamber over the tender into the adjacent waggon was a
simple matter.&nbsp; Still simpler, in expert hands, was the process of
forcing up the hoop of one of the barrels, tapping it and drawing it till
the engine bucket foamed alluringly, then plugging it up <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>again, and drawing back
the hoop into its original position.&nbsp; On delivery the consignee might
complain of short weight, but that it was a question for the brewer and the
company to settle as best they could.&nbsp; None of the running staff knew
anything about it; and, as for the lateness of the train, well, was any
train ever punctual in those days, and who bothered about half an
hour&rsquo;s delay?</p>
<p>Besides, there was something more important to bother about.&nbsp;
Actions in Chancery had begun to distract the attention of worried
directors, and these retarded progress with the construction of the
line.&nbsp; So it was not until June 1869 that the Cambrian continued
beyond Penmaenpool, and, even when Dolgelley was eventually approached,
passengers had to alight at a platform some little distance from the
town.&nbsp; Only when the Great Western Railway from Ruabon was completed
did the trains from Barmouth Junction run into Dolgelley station
proper.</p>
<p>Many and difficult as were the engineering problems involved in the
construction of the coast line none aroused greater interest or put
scientific skill and courage to a severer test than that, to which we have
already briefly alluded, of carrying the railway over the sand and river
current into Barmouth.&nbsp; To the lay mind it appeared an almost
insuperable task, and there were those who did not hesitate to whisper
their doubts as to its practicability, one well-known local gentleman being
reported to have gone as far as publicly to undertake to eat the first
engine which ever crossed that formidable gulf.&nbsp; But engineers and
craftsmen set to work with a will, and before long what had appeared an
impossibility was rapidly taking shape as an actuality.&nbsp; Eight hundred
yards in length, the greater portion was constructed on timber piles, over
500 in number, in 113 spans, driven into the sand.&nbsp; The navigable <!--
page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>channel,
at the Barmouth end, was crossed by an iron-work construction, of seven
fixed and one opening span.&nbsp; The latter was of the drawbridge type,
and when lifted at one end by means of large screws was carried on wheels
and could be drawn back over the adjoining span.</p>
<p>It was a lengthy as well as a cumbersome operation, and when, in 1899,
the ironwork portion of the viaduct had become too weak for the constantly
increasing loads of developing traffic, it was completely renewed with a
modern steel structure of four spans, one of which was a spring span,
revolving on the centre pier and giving two clear openings.&nbsp; The piers
carrying the girders are formed of columns 8ft. in diameter sunk through
the sand down to solid rock, which was reached at a depth of about 90 feet
below high water mark.&nbsp; The columns are steel cylinders filled with
concrete, and were sunk into position by means of compressed air on the
diving bell principle, and owing to the depth below water at high tide, the
men excavating inside were finally working under a pressure of three
atmospheres, or 45 lbs. to the square inch.&nbsp; The contractors were the
Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co. Ltd., of Darlington.&nbsp; In 1906,
and the following two or three years, the timber portion of the viaduct was
also completely renewed in the same material, the contractor in this case
being Mr. Abraham Williams of Aberdovey, who had built, or helped to build,
many of the old wooden bridges on the coast line.&nbsp; The total cost of
the renewals was approximately &pound;60,000, and it is no small
achievement that they were carried out without a moment&rsquo;s stoppage in
the traffic.</p>

</a></p>
<p>But even the original viaduct, old-fashioned as it may seem now, was a
wonder in those days, and the fact that it carried (and still carries) a
footpath as well as the railway, <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>provides Barmouth with a promenade unrivalled
in character and in range of panorama of river and mountains and sea
anywhere in this country.&nbsp; For a time before it was completely
finished a carriage was drawn over the bridge by horses, but in 1867 it was
opened for regular traffic, and in the first train which crossed it into
Barmouth rode the gentleman, who was under contract to make a meal of the
locomotive.&nbsp; If he had forgotten his rash undertaking, he was very
soon to receive a startling reminder.&nbsp; On safe arrival on the northern
shore, the story goes, he was politely escorted by an official to a table
laid for one, and was courteously requested to elect whether he would have
the engine roast or boiled.&nbsp; Alas! for the frailty of human nature,
more especially where a sense of humour might stand us in good stead.&nbsp;
The sceptic, disillusioned, is stated to have failed to appreciate the
joke!</p>
<p>Once the estuary was bridged, north of Barmouth, the constructional
problems were simpler of solution, and when the contractors reached
Minffordd, they were able to take advantage of an earlier engineering
enterprise, no less remarkable than any railway building.&nbsp; In former
days the sea had covered what is now called the Traeth, the broad valley of
the Glaslyn, stretching from the hillocks of Penrhyndeudraeth to
Moel-y-Gest, overlooking Portmadoc.&nbsp; The tides then surged several
miles up this vale, and washed the walls of Llanfrothen churchyard, while
vessels bore their freights almost up to Pont Aberglaslyn.&nbsp; In 1791
Mr. Madocks, following the example of earlier builders of sea walls in the
district, purchased the Tan-yr-allt estate, and soon set to work to make
dry land of a large part of the ocean bed.&nbsp; He erected what, in the
locality, is commonly called a &ldquo;cob,&rdquo; the great embankment
which runs across the mouth of the former estuary, shut out the sea and
recaptured 4,500 acres from its rapacious maw.&nbsp; Behind the shelter of
this embankment <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>(along the top of which the Festiniog Railway
runs), the new line was comparatively easily carried over the marshy
ground, and no greater gulf had to be bridged than the narrow channel in
which the river, flowing down from the bosom of Snowdon, some eight or nine
miles away, is now confined.</p>
<p>But there were other difficulties to be faced&mdash;difficulties not so
easily overcome as even mountain torrents and sandy estuaries.&nbsp; The
hand of the law was heavy upon the constructors, and even when the line was
practically ready for opening, so long a delay took place in settling
outstanding claims that the track became almost derelict.&nbsp; For these
were anxious days for railway promoters.&nbsp; The rosy promise of rich
revenues from remote Welsh lines failed to mature, and Mr. Savin, heavily
weighted with the immensity of his undertakings, and crushed by the costly
construction of his great hotels, sank under the burden.&nbsp; He faced his
financial embarrassments with characteristic pluck, but it was a dark hour
in the annals of British finance far beyond the boundaries of the
Principality, amidst which came the sensational failure of the Overend and
Gurney Bank, and, so far as the Welsh Coast Railway in particular was
concerned, the interminable legal wrangles not only cost money, but
postponed the hour at which the line could earn its keep.</p>
<p>Even under these adverse circumstances trains did occasionally run,
carrying pigs from Pwllheli, or a small load of coal or timber for some
outlying farmer or builder, or a passenger or two willing to take the risk
of an adventurous journey liable at any moment to be brought to a sudden
termination by the barriers of the bailiffs.&nbsp; But even bailiffs are
human; and at night, when they slept, or were turned away by subtle
hospitality at some neighbouring hostelry, journeys could be made, dashing
down from Portmadoc to Barmouth and back with all the exhilaration of a
secret expedition.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Eventually assistance came to the hard-pressed promoters, and the
line was officially opened for traffic from Barmouth to Pwllheli on October
10th, 1867.&nbsp; But the number of trains often depended on the state of
the exchequer, and sometimes quaint incidents would occur to break the
monotony of events.&nbsp; One driver arriving from Pwllheli at Portmadoc,
in the early days, discovering that there was no &ldquo;staff&rdquo;
available to enable him to proceed to Penrhyndeudraeth according to
regulations, was in considerable perplexity as to what to do, when an
ingenious sub-official bethought him of a scheme, and fetching an old
carpenter&rsquo;s auger, wrapped it round with paper, and thus armed by
what perpetrated to be the badge of authority to go forward, the driver
blew his whistle and off the train went on its hazardous way.</p>
<p>On another occasion an official of the line visiting one station master
on this section was startled, in reply to his cheery inquiry as to whether
all was well with him, to learn that &ldquo;the only drawback was that he
had the devil in his parlour.&rdquo;&nbsp; On his exclamation of
incredulous alarm, the stationmaster said that he would show the official,
if he would come and see.&nbsp; Entering the station house with some
trepidation, he beheld in the middle of the parlour one of the iron
fire-brackets, used to prevent water troughs from freezing in cold weather,
popularly known among railway men as &ldquo;devils.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems
that the builders had neglected to put in a grate, and the poor man had had
to fall back on this diabolical method of keeping himself warm!&nbsp; The
matter, no doubt, was quickly righted, for stationmasters, even then, were
important functionaries, often wearing tall silk hats, though some of them
were regarded as passing rich on 15/- or 16/- a week.</p>
<p>It was something, however, that, in the face of all these difficulties,
financial and constructive, a line should be completed along this wandering
coast at all.&nbsp; Only in one respect, <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>indeed, did the
original project fall short of attainment.&nbsp; The great objective of
which the shareholders heard so much in earlier days&mdash;Porth
Dinlleyn&mdash;was never reached.&nbsp; The line still terminates at
Pwllheli, where, up to 1901, the station lay at arm&rsquo;s length from the
town close to the harbour, which, in hot weather, used sometimes to alarm
arriving visitors by its fishy odours.&nbsp; In 1901 power was obtained to
carry the line into the centre of the town, where a new and commodious
station now serves this popular health resort, the gateway to the
mysterious fastnesses of Lleyn.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The traveller along the main artery of the Cambrian, from Whitchurch to
Aberystwyth, will note that, as he proceeds on his way, past the Welsh
border foothills, and on by the waters of the Severn to the highlands of
central Montgomeryshire, a series of more or less attractive lateral
valleys branch off to the left, and still more definitely, to the
right.&nbsp; Up some of these the eyes of ambitious engineers and railway
promoters had often been cast as the main line was being constructed.&nbsp;
No less eagerly did the residents at the <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>remoter ends of these
sequestered hollows among the hills look forward to the day when they might
be linked up with the central system, and so brought into direct touch with
the great world beyond.</p>
<p>There had, as we have seen, already been plans for carrying a line right
up the Vyrnwy or the Tanat Valley, through the Berwyns to the vale of the
Dee&mdash;the wonderful West Midland line which was to run from Shrewsbury
to the shores of Cardigan Bay, over hill and down dale with &ldquo;only one
tunnel.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the route left Llanfyllin eight miles to the
south, and Llanfyllin, as the largest town among these upland valleys, was
not disposed to take that lying down.&nbsp; The Oswestry and Newtown line
crossed the end of the vale, at Llanymynech, only nine miles away, and that
was clearly the route by which the engineers could most easily construct a
connective link.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1860, one of Llanfyllin&rsquo;s
most prominent citizens, Mr. J. Pugh, had posted over to Oswestry, where he
had an interview with Mr. Whalley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you help us to get a
railway?&rdquo; Yes, anything in his power, the hon. Member for
Peterboro&rsquo; would do, and he was as good as his word.&nbsp; Within a
month a crowded audience pressed into the Llanfyllin Town Hall to listen to
the scheme which Mr. Whalley and his colleagues had to lay before
them.&nbsp; The chair was taken by Mr. R. M. Bonner Maurice, of Bodynfoel,
who had, it was happily recalled, presided at one of the meetings eight
years earlier at Newtown out of which the germ of the Montgomeryshire
Railways sprang.&nbsp; This was, indeed, good augury, and when, not only
Mr. Whalley and Mr. Johns, with their enthusiasm, but Mr. George Owen, with
his plans in his pocket, came before them to show how the thing could be
done, at a cost of some &pound;60,000, enthusiasm rose high.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>The meeting, however, was not &ldquo;like Bridgnorth election, all
on one side.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. A. C. Sheriff, of Worcester, manager of the
West Midland Railway, existent, so far, merely on paper, was there too,
only he had no plans in his pocket, and little more than vague notions in
his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;If&rdquo; they did make a second tunnel, out of the
Tanat Valley, then Llanfyllin should certainly be brought on to their main
line, which would carry the farmers straight into Shrewsbury market.&nbsp;
The farmers, however, did not want to go to Shrewsbury market.&nbsp; They
wanted to go to Oswestry and Welshpool, and it was by Llanymynech that
their way lay.&nbsp; So it scarcely needed Mr. Abraham Howell&rsquo;s
warning to avoid the &ldquo;shoals and pitfalls&rdquo; which threatened any
deviation from the branch line scheme.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great companies,&rdquo;
cried the redoubtable lawyer, &ldquo;have been the bane of
Montgomeryshire,&rdquo; and Llanfyllin shouted back that they would have
none of them, whether they found they could tunnel out of the Tanat Valley
or not.&nbsp; Besides, &ldquo;if&rdquo; the West Midland could not put
Llanfyllin on the main line&mdash;and a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo; it
seemed&mdash;then, Mr. Sheriff admitted, it would not touch the town at
all.</p>
<p>So, sweeping aside all &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts,&rdquo;
Llanfyllin voted for the Llanymynech branch.&nbsp; Whether it might be
worked as an independent undertaking or as part of the Oswestry and Newtown
Company&rsquo;s concern, mattered comparatively little.&nbsp; In either
case, Mr. Savin was ready to guarantee a dividend of 4&frac12; per cent.,
and Mr. Whalley had so much confidence in the firm of contractors that he
would back the guarantee with his own name.&nbsp; Big companies should have
no blighting and delaying influence on their little valley.&nbsp; Like the
other local companies to which Mr. Howell alluded as examples of
self-reliance, they would &ldquo;trust to their own exertions,&rdquo; and
since, as somebody said, the Oswestry and Newtown Railway <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>was already a concrete
fact, and no mere hypothetical proposition, it was agreed to &ldquo;join
heart and hand&rdquo; with the company.&nbsp; A resolution to that effect
was proposed by Mr. C. R. Jones, seconded by Mr. John Jones&mdash;two names
long intimately associated in close comradeship with the public life of
Llanfyllin&mdash;and carried unanimously; a similar conclusion being
arrived at at a meeting of &ldquo;a few of the most influential inhabitants
of Llanymynech,&rdquo; with the Rev. J. Luxmoore, Rector, in the chair,
later in the day.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As to the rival West Midland scheme, like the ogre in the fairy tale
which ends happily ever afterwards, &ldquo;little more was heard of
it,&rdquo; at any rate as a great through route from Shrewsbury to the
sea.&nbsp; The project was revived in the Parliamentary session of 1864,
and a crowded meeting at Llanrhaiadr gave it tumultuous blessing in speech
and bardic effusion. <a name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a>&nbsp; But, though ultimately a line was
constructed from Shrewsbury (as we have shown in a previous chapter) it got
no further than the Nantmawr quarries, a few miles north-west of
Llanymynech, and after running some years, became derelict, until revived
under the Light Railways Act as the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire
Railway.&nbsp; Not until 1904 did the Tanat Valley itself echo to the sound
of any sort of railway coach, &ldquo;lightning&rdquo; or otherwise.&nbsp;
Here again it was the Light Railways Act which made construction
possible.&nbsp; The Tanat Valley Light Railway Company was formed, the
directors being gentlemen interested in the locality, with Alderman Charles
E. Williams, of Oswestry, as Chairman.&nbsp; After some controversy as to
whether the line should be narrow guage, starting from Oswestry and <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>running
along the Morda Valley through Llansilin, or an ordinary guage extension of
the mineral branch from Llynclys to Porthywaen, via Llanyblodwel, the
latter plan was adopted, and, under pressure from the Earl of Bradford, a
large local landowner, a connection was also formed over the old Nantmawr
mineral line to Llanymynech.&nbsp; The railway which had its terminus at
Llangynog has well served an important quarrying and agricultural district,
but it has never flourished financially.&nbsp; For many years, indeed, the
Company existed only in name, and in 1921 it was formally absorbed in the
Cambrian, which had worked it, under agreement, from the outset.</p>
<p>But let us go back to the more successful enterprise in the neighbouring
valley.&nbsp; The middle of July 1863 saw the Llanfyllin branch ready for
traffic and on the seventeenth the opening ceremony took place.&nbsp; It
included an excursion to Borth in twenty-three carriages packed with
people, many of whom had never seen the sea.&nbsp; The train, we are told
by a contemporary chronicler, failed to keep time, but who cared?&nbsp;
There were some piquant scenes on the beach when the ladies, essaying to
bathe, found themselves closely surrounded by &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; in
anchored boats, but that, again, was a short-coming in the ordered
programme which was readily overlooked!&nbsp; Anyhow, it seems, a good many
people managed to miss the return train which &ldquo;started
punctually&rdquo; at 1-30, arriving at Llanfyllin at half-past five, and so
they also missed the dinner, presided over by the High Sheriff of
Montgomeryshire, Mr. J. Dugdale, and the speeches, with which the official
proceedings closed.&nbsp; The next day, following the precedent set at the
opening of the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, Messrs. Savin and Ward
entertained the navvies to a &ldquo;good substantial dinner&rdquo; of their
own, after which <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>they, too, were entertained to a flow of
oratory from the &ldquo;big wigs&rdquo; of the railway company and the
locality, and another series of toasts were honoured with &ldquo;three
times three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promoters had cautiously qualified their promises as to the length
of the branch by proposing to have its terminus at Llanfyllin for
&ldquo;the present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some years later, when the Liverpool City
Council, seeking fresh water supplies for their growing community, found a
rich source in the valley of the Vyrnwy at Llanwddyn and constructed their
giant works at what is now Lake Vyrnwy, thoughts began to turn to the
prospect of a continuation of the railway in that direction, but it was not
a practicable proposition.&nbsp; Up the Llanfyllin branch, however, there
came the bulk of the stores, including the huge pipes, and the Portland
cement for the bed of the lake.&nbsp; The cement was landed in bags at
Aberdovey and from Llanfyllin a team of ninety-five horses was employed to
draw it by road to the site of the works.&nbsp; Half were stabled at
Llanfyllin and half at the Lake, and those in charge noted a curious
fact.&nbsp; The horses living at the Lake went down empty in the morning
and came back loaded in the afternoon, and in a few years were all out of
condition, whereas those who started in the morning with their heavy load
from Llanfyllin and returned empty later in the day were always in
excellent fettle.&nbsp; To-day the development of the motor has solved many
a transport problem where heavy loads are concerned, but Llanfyllin
remains, perhaps, the most convenient approach to Lake Vyrnwy for the
increasing number of visitors who go year by year to enjoy its scenic
beauties and its piscatorial delights.</p>
<p>Less rapid success attended a similar enterprise a dozen miles
away.&nbsp; While the good folks of Llanfyllin were pushing <!-- page
97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>on with their
branch, the residents of Llanfair Caereinion were asking themselves why
they, too, should not have their railway.&nbsp; Here, also, the initial
problem was one of route; but, instead of a somewhat easily disposed-of
rivalry on the part of a competitive company, the crux here was the measure
of support which could be won from the owner of the Powis estate, through
which it would almost inevitably, in some form or another, have to
pass.&nbsp; In July 1862 Mr. R. D. Pryce of Cyfronaith, who was much
interested in the development of the Llanfair district, asked the Earl of
Powis to receive a deputation, but to a proposal that the line should go by
the Black Pool dingle his lordship found himself unable to agree.&nbsp; The
promoters were disappointed, for it seemed at the time, that no other way
was feasible.&nbsp; But a month later another route was discovered, by way
of Newton Lane, Berriew and Castle Caereinion and so by Melinyrhyd Gate to
Llanfair; or, as an alternative suggestion, from Forden or Montgomery by
the &ldquo;Luggy Brook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A meeting was held at Llanfair at which Mr. Edwin Hilton explained a
scheme which was estimated to cost &pound;60,000, of which &pound;20,000
should first be raised in ordinary shares, the rest to be made up
afterwards of preference shares and debentures.&nbsp; But nothing directly
came of it, and it was not until October, 1864, that another proposal was
formulated, this time of more ambitious character.&nbsp; This was a
variation of the original Shrewsbury and West Midland route, which
Llanfyllin had already laughed out of countenance, starting from Welshpool
and making its way through Llanfair over (or rather under) the Berwyns to
the Great Western system by the Dee.&nbsp; Mr. David Davies, on being
consulted, favoured a 2ft. 3in. guage, though he advised that enough land
should be taken and bridges built to accommodate an ordinary <!-- page
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>guage later if
found necessary.&nbsp; The minimum speed on the narrow guage was to be
fifteen miles an hour, and it was estimated that the average receipts would
work out at &pound;5 per mile.</p>
<p>Amongst the leading advocates of this scheme was Mr. Russel Aitken, a
well-known civil engineer of Westminster, the home of many Welsh railway
projects in those days.&nbsp; He got into correspondence with Lord Powis
about it, pointing out that, as a beginning, the line might be made as far
as Llanfair, and then the promoters might &ldquo;wait and see.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Powis Castle was not so easily to be persuaded.&nbsp; The Earl
considered a railway from Welshpool below Llanfair Road to Sylvaen Hall
&ldquo;very objectionable&rdquo; and much preferred the alternative route
of branching off the Llanfyllin line at Llansantffaid, via Pont
Robert.&nbsp; This Mr. Aitken &ldquo;could not successfully try to
contest&rdquo; and therefore &ldquo;gave up the idea of trying for powers
to construct the proposed railway,&rdquo; but he still thought a line
&ldquo;from Bala to Welshpool would pay and that it would be a great
benefit to the country through which it passes.&rdquo;&nbsp; How far these
prognostications may have been justified experience has never given us
opportunity to ascertain.&nbsp; A railway through the mighty ramparts of
the Berwyns is as remote an accomplishment to-day as it ever was; though,
after many years, Llanfair itself was to obtain its narrow guage line, an
inch less than Mr. Davies&rsquo;s original design, which, under the name of
the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway, with the Earl&rsquo;s successor
as its most enthusiastic promoter and chairman, was opened for traffic on
April 4th, 1903, to be worked by the Cambrian as an important feeder to its
main system.</p>

<p>A shorter branch, some five miles in length, from Abermule winding up
the course of the Mule to the village of Kerry, was in course of
construction while these other schemes were <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>maturing or
languishing.&nbsp; On Monday, March 2nd, 1863, the first engine puffed its
way up the long incline (some of it as steep as 1 in 43) to Kerry, drawing
one carriage, and on its arrival, after several stoppages on the way to
&ldquo;make steam,&rdquo; was met by a company of local ladies and
gentlemen.&nbsp; It had been intended to indulge in some speechmaking, as
befitted so auspicious an occasion, but the assembled guests were so
absorbed in shaking hands with one another and looking at the engine,
panting after its exertions, that the oratory was forgotten, and folks were
content to offer their personal congratulations to Mr. Poundley, through
whose enthusiasm and activities the branch was mainly built.&nbsp; It had
also been arranged to attach to the train a truck of coal from Abermule to
distribute amongst the poor, but this was more than the locomotive could
accomplish.&nbsp; It went up the next day, and, no doubt, contributed to a
wide endorsement of the views of the newspaper scribe, detailed to record
these stirring events, that the branch was &ldquo;everything Kerry can
want.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyhow, with its still rare trains, it is all that Kerry
has ever had, and possibly Kerry is still content.</p>
<p>The Kerry branch is also noteworthy for another thing, that it is the
first arm of the system which diverges to the east of the main line.&nbsp;
So does what was originally the first portion of the trunk, the line from
Moat Lane to Llanidloes, later extended by the amalgamation with the
Mid-Wales Railway, to Brecon, and so also does another diminutive line,
another mile further, which, though not part of the Cambrian proper,
deserves notice in these pages, if only for the personality of its former
manager.</p>
<p>This is the Van line, which ran from Caersws (whose station is built on
the site of an old Roman settlement) up to the Van mines, once productive
enough of valuable lead ore, <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>but now derelict.&nbsp; Constructed under the
Railways Construction Facilities Act, 1864, the line was opened for mineral
traffic on August 14th, 1871 and for passenger traffic on December 1st,
1873.&nbsp; It was leased to the Cambrian, but got into Chancery and was
closed a few years later.&nbsp; While it ran many made pilgrimage along its
short length, less for the purpose of traversing its rather uninteresting
course than for a chance of conversing with one of the most notable
characters, under whose charge the trains ran.&nbsp; To many Welshmen,
indeed, who never travelled on or even heard, except perhaps quite
incidentally, of the Van Railway, the name of John Ceiriog Hughes is a
household word.</p>
<p>Born at Llanarmon-Dyffryn-Ceiriog, in Denbighshire, on September 25th,
1832, he passed his early years in the romantic vale of the Ceiriog, amidst
the glowing memories of Huw Morris of Pont-y-Meibion.&nbsp; Beginning his
business career in Manchester, he soon returned to his native land, and,
after occupying a position as stationmaster at Llanidloes, was appointed to
the management of this little line.&nbsp; The duties were not particularly
arduous, and, in any case, &ldquo;Ceiriog&rdquo; was apt to take life with
a light heart.&nbsp; Whether he sat in his office or in the cosy corner of
some favourite rural inn the muse burned brightly within him, and, from his
remote retreat among the hills which look down on the infant Severn, he
poured out his soul in poetry, which ranks high in Celtic literature.&nbsp;
Welsh verse always suffers in translation into the more cumbrous English,
but there are many who have known the charm even of an Anglicised version
of &ldquo;Myvanwy Vychan,&rdquo; and when he died, in 1887, he was
acclaimed by such an authority as the Rev. H. Elvet Lewis, to be &ldquo;one
of the best lyrical poets of Wales,&rdquo; who had &ldquo;rendered

Robert Burns did for Scottish melodies.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was buried in
Llanwnog churchyard, where a simple plate marks his resting place, and
friends and neighbours who attended the funeral service on the following
Sunday did not feel that it was out of place that it should have been based
on the text &ldquo;Know ye not that there is . . . a great man fallen this
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; They did know it, humble as his station might be; and
more than one of his admirers has since visited the little deserted office
where he worked on the Van line and ransacked its drawers and cupboards for
hidden gems of poesy he might have left behind him.&nbsp; Alas! nothing
more inspiring was ever found there than faded way-bills and torn
invoices!&nbsp; But who shall say that there is no romance clinging close
around even the humblest, and now the most woe-begone, of all the little
offshoots of the Cambrian?</p>

<p>Lord John Russell, it is said, used, in conversation with Queen
Victoria, to date all political development from the Revolution of
1688.&nbsp; If those mystic figures signalize the birthday of Whiggery, in
the political world, in much the same way we may date the constitution of
the Cambrian, as we know it to-day, from the year 1864.&nbsp; In more than
one way it was a notable period in Welsh railway annals.&nbsp; The various
independent links in the chain were either completed and wholly or
partially in working order, or in course of construction.&nbsp; Thanks to
the influential efforts of the Earl of Powis, arrangements had been made
with the Post Office and the London and North Western Railway Company,
through Sir Richard Moon, for the conveyance of mails from Shrewsbury to
Borth, the then terminus.&nbsp; Through working arrangements were also in
force among the various local companies, and it was obvious that the time
had come to face the problems of future policy.&nbsp; These were not
altogether of simple solution.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Very early in the year Mr. Abraham Howell was moved, in one of his
frequent letters to the Earl of Powis, to warn his lordship that he scented
&ldquo;another crisis coming on in <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the affairs of the
Welsh Railways.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once more there was division of opinion and
&ldquo;parties&rdquo; were forming.&nbsp; Mr. Piercy and the majority of
the directors were for extending &ldquo;the&rdquo; Welsh system so as to
make it independent of the great companies and set aside existing
agreements and obligations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Howell himself, with Mr. Savin
and a minority on the Board, inclined rather to the course of accommodation
with circumstances, making the best of the lines and properties of the
companies as they stood, avoiding extensions and increasing capital, while
cultivating friendly arrangements with neighbouring companies and so
avoiding as much as possible Parliamentary and legal conflicts.</p>
<p>After all the tribulations through which these undertakings had passed
the more politic and pacific course certainly had its advantages, but one
Parliamentary adventure could not easily be avoided.&nbsp; Whether the
policy was to be one of splendid isolation or of neighbourly friendship,
the moment was obviously ripe for some measure of internal consolidation,
and powers were sought for this purpose.&nbsp; The Bill had to pass through
the now familiar ordeal of battle, both in the Committee of the House of
Commons and in the House of Lords, when many of the old arguments and some
new ones were skilfully marshalled on behalf of the Great Western Railway
Company and rolled on the tongue of eminent and eloquent counsel.&nbsp;
Even the little Bishop&rsquo;s Castle undertaking threw in its lot with the
opposition, finding a powerful protagonist in Mr. Whalley.&nbsp; But the
Cambrian had stout friends to put in the witness-box.&nbsp; Earl Vane
proved a tough nut to crack in cross-examination.&nbsp; So did the Earl of
Powis, still apparently tinged with a North Western bias.&nbsp; With the
result that after much forensic oratory, closing appropriately on a
reminder of &ldquo;the troubles and difficulties the companies <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>had gone
through,&rdquo; and a well deserved &ldquo;tribute to the energy and talent
of their solicitor, Mr. Abraham Howell,&rdquo; the Amalgamation Bill,
excluding for the time being the Welsh Coast line, was passed into law in
July, 1864.</p>
<p>It set up a joint board, limited to a minimum of six and a maximum of
twelve, the first directors chosen being those who had similarly served the
several independent companies, some of whom, of course, had acted on more
than one of these concerns.&nbsp; The following year, some previous
difficulties being removed, the Welsh Coast Railway was brought into the
combine, and the Cambrian then assumed the organic shape in which it
remained until the further amalgamation with the Mid-Wales Railway in
1904.</p>
<p>Financially, however, the directors still swam in troubled waters.&nbsp;
Creditors became impatient and began to press their claims.&nbsp; More than
one suit was brought against the Company involving long and expensive
proceedings in the Court of Chancery, and very early in 1868 it was found
necessary to convene, at Oswestry, a meeting of the &ldquo;mortgagees,
holders of certificates of indebtedness and other creditors, and of the
preference and ordinary proprietors for the consideration of the best means
of dealing with the conflicting and other claims and interests of the
company&rsquo;s creditors and proprietors and of passing such resolutions
in regard thereto, or any of them, as might at such meeting be deemed
expedient.&rdquo;&nbsp; To obtain some means of getting out of the
financial morass in which the undertaking was floundering was
&ldquo;expedient&rdquo; indeed, and it is hardly surprising to find that,
in view of the many conflicts of interest, the assembly is recorded to have
been both &ldquo;large and influential.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bancroft presided
in the absence of Earl Vane, chairman of the Company, and he was supported
by the directors and <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>officials who had done much to bring the
Cambrian into existence and were now struggling to put it on its
feet.&nbsp; The scheme which was laid before the meeting was long and
complicated.&nbsp; More than one meeting was required to thrash matters
out, but in the end a readjustment was arrived at, and a new scheme was
adopted for constituting the board.&nbsp; From July 1st, 1868, until
December 31st, 1878, it consisted of ten directors, four of whom were
elected by the Coast Section and four by the Inland Section, the other two
seats being in the nomination of Earl Vane and the Earl of Powis.&nbsp; The
revenue from the whole undertakings went into a common fund, and, after
deducting working expenses, the surplus was divided between the Coast and
Inland Sections in certain proportions, to be determined by arbitrators and
an umpire.&nbsp; Admirable as this arrangement might be in theory, in
practice we know what generally happens when</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;United, yet divided, twain at once<br />
Sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it is hardly astonishing that this form of dual authority should
have led to a good deal of squabbling between the rival
&ldquo;monarchs.&rdquo;&nbsp; It proved, indeed, a cumbrous contrivance,
and, when the period for its operation terminated, with the close of 1878,
the constitution of the board was allowed to revert to the limits laid down
under the Act of 1864, without any provision for sectional directors at
all.&nbsp; During these intervening years, indeed, questions of finance and
of the upkeep of the lines were still for ever cropping up, and not always
as readily disposed of.&nbsp; It is a long and dreary story of the
inevitable struggles with ways and means which so often marks the life of
pioneer undertakings.&nbsp; For years these Chancery suits hung like chains
about the company&rsquo;s <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>neck, and even into the eighties the directors
were never free from sudden embarrassments and never knew from what quarter
they might proceed.</p>
<p>One such difficulty, indeed, ultimately proved a blessing in
disguise.&nbsp; In 1884, at the instance of the Company&rsquo;s bankers,
the line was placed in the hands of a Receiver, Mr. John Conacher,
fortunately, being chosen for this office.&nbsp; The line was ripe for a
great and final effort to place the undertaking on a firmer footing, and,
together with the late Mr. A. C. Humphreys-Owen, Mr. Conacher drew up a
scheme of arrangement between the Company and its creditors under which
about seventy different stocks were consolidated into ten; and it was their
patient and skilful work in thus formulating what became known as the
scheme of 1885, that laid the foundation of the Company&rsquo;s improved
financial position of which the proprietors and the public have reaped the
benefit in subsequent years.</p>
<p>Meantime, however, other matters not directly bearing on finance,
engaged the attention of the directors.&nbsp; Amongst these was the
question of the works, which it was found necessary to erect, since the
Company was working its own line.&nbsp; In July 1864, the inhabitants of
Welshpool, conscious of the prominent part which the town had played in the
inauguration of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, presented a memorial to
the board in which they urged its central position on the system and the
recent completion of the waterworks as strong arguments for favourable
consideration of the borough&rsquo;s claims to such an advantage.&nbsp; Nor
was it without an eye to future development that Welshpool station was
built in a manner capable of allowing its upper stories to be used as the
Company&rsquo;s offices.&nbsp; Here, for the brief space, the offices were,
but in both these cases ambitious Poolonians were doomed to
disappointment.</p>

107</span>The official headquarters of the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway
Company were destined for some time to remain at Machynlleth, where Mr.
David Howell, its secretary, practised as a solicitor; but in January 1862
the staff of the Oswestry and Newtown had removed from Welshpool, and,
together with those of the Llanidloes and Newtown, the Oswestry, Ellesmere
and Whitchurch, the Buckley and the Wrexham Mold and Connah&rsquo;s Quay,
jointly occupied two rooms on the second floor of No. 9a, Cannon Row,
Westminster, Mr. George Lewis being secretary of all five companies.&nbsp;
On the floor below the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Company cohabited with
some dozen slate and stone companies, while Mr. Benjamin Piercy sat in
state hard by in Great George Street, and Mr. Thomas Savin weaved his
ambitious schemes around the corner, at No. 7, Delahay Street, with Mr.
James Fraser (father of the auditor of the Cambrian in recent years)
acting, under power of attorney, as his manager.&nbsp; This proved quite a
convenient arrangement so long as Parliamentary Committee work absorbed
much of the time of these officials, and here all the companies held their
board meetings, generally on the same day.</p>
<p>There were stirring times without, and it is scarcely strange if Cannon
Row did not live up to the reputation of its suggestive name.&nbsp; Rows,
indeed, were frequent and occasionally threatened to reverberate beyond the
walls of the official sanctum.&nbsp; There is an old and honoured Cambrian
official, then a young clerk sitting at his desk in the office above the
board room, who remembers the occasion when an extraordinary scene was
enacted on that dusty little stage.&nbsp; From a scuffle of some sort in
the board room Mr. Gartside, a Director of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway
Company, beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the clerk&rsquo;s room,
closely <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>pursued by Mr. Whalley.&nbsp; Mr. Gartside being rather portly,
was much out of breath, and suddenly pausing and turning round to recover
himself on gaining the hearthrug he received Mr. Whalley&rsquo;s fist full
in the stomach, which completed his exhaustion.&nbsp; Recovering his breath
and as much of his dignity as the circumstances would permit, the disabled
Director appealing dramatically to the astonished clerks, exclaimed
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I call on you to witness that the hon. Member for
Peterboro&rsquo; has struck me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the clerks unable to
grapple with so unaccustomed a situation, beat a hasty retreat, and nothing
more was heard of what was presumably a more or less accidental
&ldquo;assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Great George Street, the offices were subsequently moved to No. 3,
Westminster Chambers, and soon after Mr. Savin&rsquo;s failure, in 1866,
when the directors took over the working of the line from the unfortunate
lessee, after a short trial of another London office, the Secretary and his
staff, in August of that year, packed up pens, ink, paper and documents and
settled themselves in Oswestry, where they have since remained.&nbsp; In
Oswestry, too, on a site under the Shelf Bank, close to where the first sod
on the Ellesmere and Oswestry line was cut, the works were erected and have
continued to be maintained.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On a subsequent occasion, however, they were the ostensible cause of one
of those sudden storms which, as we have said, from time to time assailed
the board-room or even periodical assemblies of the proprietors.&nbsp; On
this occasion it was, indeed, a bolt from the blue.&nbsp; A few days before
the date fixed for the half yearly meeting, at Crewe, in February 1879,
there had been placed in the hands of the shareholders a pamphlet bearing
the innocent title &ldquo;Cambrian Railways Workshops.&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
when they read it, the recipients discovered <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>that, whatever the
reason for the choice of such a heading, the sermon was founded on a much
wider text.&nbsp; It traversed the whole policy of the Board, the
constitution of the Company and the management of its property, and it was
written in highly censorious terms.&nbsp; That, in itself, might have been
of comparatively little moment, for the directors were not without their
critics&mdash;no directors of public companies ever are.&nbsp; But the
author, who did not withhold his name, was Mr. David Davies, constructor of
much of the line and now one of the most influential directors.&nbsp; Here,
apparently, was a matter for serious concern, and the seriousness was not
diminished when to the pamphlet itself was added a speech, at the
shareholders&rsquo; meeting, in which Mr. Davies did not scruple to suggest
that the line was being expensively worked, that the rolling stock had not
been adequately maintained, that the road was defective and that, some of
the stock being worthless, the whole undertaking was in a false
position.&nbsp; It was what Earl Vane (now become Marquess of Londonderry),
who presided, called &ldquo;a stab in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stab in
the open with which Mr. Davies followed it up was certainly not less
sensational.&nbsp; He declared that &ldquo;the line at the moment was not
safe, and he should not be at all surprised to see the rails sprinkled with
human blood before they were very much older.&rdquo;&nbsp; He alleged that
a fellow director (Mr. S. H. Hadley) had expressed a wish to see the
Oswestry shops burnt down and new shops erected at Aberystwyth
instead.&nbsp; The balance-sheet was &ldquo;an insult.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
washed his hands of the whole affair and demanded a Committee of
Inquiry.&nbsp; A hub-bub ensued, amidst which it was not impertinently
pointed out that Mr. Davies had himself laid much of the road which he now
condemned, and, backed by a letter from Mr. George Owen, the engineer, it
was shown that his strictures on its <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>existing condition
were unsubstantiated by facts.&nbsp; But Mr. Davies stuck to his guns, and
before what was well described in the local Press as &ldquo;a stormy
meeting&rdquo; terminated, he had left the room and his seat on the
Board.&nbsp; It was a matter of doubt, for some moments, whether the noble
Chairman would not go too, but, happily, he discovered enough signs of
confidence among the proprietors present to encourage him to continue his
thankless task.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous tempest while it lasted, but it was soon over.&nbsp;
At the next half-yearly meeting, in the following August, the directors
were able to report that, instead of spilt blood, the summer had brought a
considerably increased weight of tourist traffic, hearty congratulations
were showered on Mr. George Lewis, the Secretary, on his efficient
administration of the line, and Capt. R. D. Pryce, presiding, in the
absence of the Marquess, concluded the proceedings on a happy note of
assurance that directors and shareholders were &ldquo;of one mind,&rdquo;
and full of sanguine expectations as to the future of their
undertaking.&nbsp; The throes of consolidation are sometimes not less
severe than those of birth itself, but they can be as successfully
survived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Railway travelling is safer than walking, riding, driving,

Watkin</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on considerably more than half a century of history it is
no small tribute to human care and human ingenuity that serious accidents
on the Cambrian Railways have been relatively rare.&nbsp; This is all the
more remarkable because all but some twelve miles of its total length, and
up to a few years ago, not even as much as that, has had to be worked on a
single line, and with the rapidly increasing tourist traffic of recent
times, this has placed a strain on both the human and the metallic machine
which may easily try the strongest nerves and the most powerful
appliances.&nbsp; Obviously it is due to the special care taken in
management, and observed, with few if tragic exceptions, by those directly
responsible for the working of the trains.</p>
<p>Early in their inception, elaborate regulations were drawn up by the
organisers of the original local undertakings, of which a copy, issued by
the Oswestry and Newtown Company, as adopted &ldquo;at a meeting of the
Board of Directors, held on Saturday, the 25th February, 1860,&rdquo; and
preserved among the papers of the late Mr. David Howell of Machynlleth,
gives some <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>interesting indication.&nbsp; It is bound in vellum, fitted with
a clasp, and adorned within with a series of woodcuts, descriptive of the
old-day signalman, clad in tall hat, tail coat and white trousers,
explanatory of the hand signal code, with flags, which preceded the more
general use of the modern signals, controlled from a signal box.&nbsp;
Following the precept, made familiar by the nursery rhymes of our
childhood, it informs us that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;RED is a signal of DANGER, and to STOP.</p>
<p>GREEN is a signal of CAUTION, and to GO SLOWLY.</p>
<p>WHITE is a Signal of ALL RIGHT, and to GO ON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an additional precaution, should no flag be handy, it warns drivers
that &ldquo;anything moved violently up and down or a man holding both
hands up is a sign of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of these early regulations were extremely primitive.&nbsp; For
instance, long before the scientific system of the block telegraph and the
tablet were thought out, it was deemed sufficient to ordain that &ldquo;On
a Train or Engine stopping at or passing an intermediate station or
Junction, a STOP Signal must be exhibited for FIVE minutes, after which a
CAUTION Signal must be exhibited for FIVE minutes more.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
that, apparently, any train might proceed&mdash;and take its risk of the
one in front having reached the next signalling point!&nbsp; At level
crossings at any distance from the signalman, the gate-keeper was advised
to &ldquo;ring a small hand-bell, or use a whistle to call the attention of
the signalman, who must then put up his &lsquo;Danger&rsquo;
signals.&rdquo;</p>

<img alt="An Early Cambrian Passenger Engine.  Original Form (top), As

</a></p>
<p>The guard of the first passenger train from Oswestry was instructed to
&ldquo;set his timepiece by the Platform Clock, and give the Clerk at every
station the time, so that he may regulate the clock at his station by
it,&rdquo; and similar arrangements operated up the branch lines.&nbsp;
Porters were told that <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>on the arrival of a train they were to
&ldquo;walk the length of the platform and call out, in a clear and audible
voice, the name of the station opposite the window of each carriage; and at
Junctions the doors of every carriage must be opened, and the various
changes announced to all passengers&rdquo;&mdash;a regulation which, if
still on the rule-book, is, like that against receiving tips, nowadays more
often honoured in the breach than in the observance.&nbsp; It was even felt
obligatory to include a regulation as to what should be done if a train
should arrive before its advertised time, though it must appear a little
superfluous to those who remember the ways of the Cambrian in those happy
days, when a captious correspondent could write to the local Press to aver
that, after seeing his father off at Welshpool station, he was able to ride
on horseback to Oswestry and meet him on his arrival there!&nbsp; It was
certainly a remarkable feat&mdash;though, perhaps, not so remarkable
either&mdash;for, as &ldquo;an official&rdquo; of the Company was moved to
explain in a subsequent issue, the old gentleman must have travelled by a
goods train, to which passenger coaches were attached &ldquo;for the
convenience of the public,&rdquo; and it &ldquo;often did not leave
Welshpool until an hour after the advertised time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those &ldquo;mixed trains&rdquo; survived until some thirty years ago,
when an unregenerate Board of Trade regulation prohibited them, and the
wonderful jolts and jars which the public experienced for their
&ldquo;convenience&rdquo; and the benefit of their liver, if not their
nerves, became a thing of the past.&nbsp; But, as an old driver remarked to
the writer not long ago,&mdash;&ldquo;It was very comfortable working in
those days,&rdquo; and no doubt, for the traffic staff, it was.</p>
<p>We may smile to-day at some of these old ordinances and habits, but
traffic then was not as congested as it is on an August day now, when
thousands of tourists are being carried <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>in heavily ladened
trains to the coast of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; The rolling stock at that time
was as light as the signals were haphazard.&nbsp; We have read of
references, in these early days, to &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; engines; but
they were mere pigmies to the modern locomotive, and some of those pioneer
machines which were the pride of the dale sixty years ago have been
relegated long since to the humble duty of the shunting yard, or rebuilt
altogether.</p>

<a href="images/page114b.jpg">
<img alt="An Early Cambrian Tank Engine.  Original Form (top), As Re-built

</a></p>
<p>An old engineman, writing some little time since in the &ldquo;Cambrian
News,&rdquo; gives an interesting retrospect of the &ldquo;comforts&rdquo;
of railway travel on the Cambrian in those early days.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
original passenger rolling stock on service on the line when opened,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;was of a small four-wheeled type, similar in construction
to the coaches on other company&rsquo;s lines; about 25 feet long over all,
13 feet wheel base, or half the length and a third the weight of the bogie
stock of the present day.&nbsp; The coaches were built by contract, the
work being divided between two well-known firms of builders,&mdash;the
Ashbury Co., Manchester, and the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon
Company, Birmingham.&nbsp; The Ashbury stock was slightly larger with more
head room than the Metropolitan.&nbsp; The coaches were built of the very
best material, the lower part of body being painted a dark brown, the upper
part, from the door handles to roof, a cream colour. <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a>&nbsp; Each coach weighed about 8 tons.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;third class&rsquo; coaches were made up of five compartments or
semi-compartments.&nbsp; Cross seats, back to back sittings for five
aside&mdash;accommodation for <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>fifty passengers&mdash;bare boards for the
seats, straight up backs, open from end to end.&nbsp; Our forefathers
evidently believed, when constructing rolling stock, in fresh air in
abundance instead of the closed up compartment of late years.&nbsp; The
thirds were lighted at dusk with two glass globe oil lamps fixed in the
roof, one at each end of the coach.&nbsp; Firsts and seconds were provided
with a lamp for each compartment.&nbsp; The only other difference between
the seconds and thirds was that the seats of the seconds were partly
covered with black oilcloth.&nbsp; The latter carriage proved
unremunerative, the public hardly ever patronising seconds.&nbsp; Therefore
they were abolished.&nbsp; In addition to the ordinary screw coupling,
coaches in those days were provided with side chains as security in case of
breaking loose on the journey.&nbsp; Side chains, however, were abolished
on the advent of the continuous brake.&nbsp; The buffers were provided with
wooden block facings with a view of silencing and to prevent friction when
travelling round curves&mdash;not at all a bad idea either.&nbsp; Wheels in
those days were constructed entirely of iron with straight axles and
spokes, not wooden blocked as at present to deaden noise.&nbsp; Owing to
the lightness of the stock, when travelling at a fair rate of speed,
oscillation occurred and passengers had to sit firm and fast, which
everyone in those days seemed to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyhow, there was plenty of fun to be got out of the experience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The doors of the old coaches were narrow, and many a tussle to get
inside occurred.&nbsp; One lady in particular who was very stout and a
regular passenger on a certain train, always had to be assisted both in and
out&mdash;the stationmaster pulling and the guard pushing, while the
fireman was enjoying the joke.&nbsp; One morning, when the train was a few
minutes late, the guard came running up to the front with his &lsquo;Hurry
<!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>up, Missis,&rsquo; when the old dame, with her two baskets, an
umbrella, similar in size to a modern camping tent, and a crinoline
fashionable in mid-Victorian days, got firmly wedged in the door way,
whereupon some wag suggested that, to expedite departure, a break-down gang
and crane should be sent for and the lady hoisted into an open cattle
waggon.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>But even with all the care which the management enjoined from the first,
accidents were, perhaps, not altogether unavoidable.&nbsp; Sometimes the
errant &ldquo;human factor&rdquo; showed itself in tragic fashion even in
those distant days.&nbsp; By a melancholy coincidence, the first serious
mishap occurred close to Abermule, a name since associated in the public
memory with the last and the worst catastrophe in Cambrian annals.</p>
<p>It was on a November morning in 1861 that a goods train leaving Newtown
for Welshpool, called at Abermule, where they picked up three wagons and
some water.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, there was time&mdash;or they thought
there was time&mdash;for the driver, fireman, and guard to adjourn to the
adjacent inn, where they took up something rather stronger than the
engine&rsquo;s refreshment.&nbsp; Time fled, as it is apt to do in such
circumstances, and when the staff rejoined the train, an effort appears to
have been made to gain lost minutes, with the result that the train ran off
the line, and driver, known to his comrades as &ldquo;Hell-fire
Jack,&rdquo; and fireman were killed.&nbsp; An inquest was held before Dr.
Slyman, coroner, one of the most enthusiastic promoters of the
Montgomeryshire lines, and the jury solemnly found that &ldquo;the accident
was the result of furious driving,&rdquo; but they exonerated from blame
everyone but &ldquo;the unfortunate driver.&rdquo;</p>

117</span>But the &ldquo;human factor&rdquo; is not the only element of
nature with which railway management has to contend.&nbsp; Another, not
less serious in its potential consequences, was brought to mind in sinister
fashion a few years later, when, during the winter storms of 1868, the
Severn and its tributaries rose in flood with such alarming rapidity that
the driver of an early morning goods train from Machynlleth to Newtown
found, as he ran down the long decline from Talerddig past Carno, that the
water was washing over the footplate of the engine, and nearly put out the
fire.&nbsp; He naturally bethought him of the wooden bridge over the Severn
at Caersws, but, after, careful examination, it was safely crossed.&nbsp;
On the return journey, however, the bridge was being carefully approached
once more, when, in the dim dawn of a February morning, the engine suddenly
toppled-over the embankment abutting on the structure.&nbsp; The floods had
washed away the earthworks, though the beams of the bridge itself held
fast, and driver and fireman were killed.&nbsp; Word was sent to Oswestry
and Aberystwyth, and in the first passenger train from the latter place
Capt. Pryce, one of the directors, and Mr. Elias, the traffic manager, were
travelling to the scene of the disaster, when it was discovered that
another bridge, near Pontdolgoch, was giving way under pressure of the
torrent, and the train, crowded with passengers, was only held up just in
time to avert what could not have failed to prove a catastrophe far more
tragic in extent.</p>
<p>Wild rumours quickly spread concerning the cause and nature of the
actual mishap, it being freely stated by sensation-mongers that the Severn
bridge had collapsed; but Mr. David Davies, who had been its builder and
was now a director of the Company, was able to show that, despite the
exceptional strain on the construction, the bridge had resisted the force
of <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>the flood and was as firm as ever.&nbsp; Wooden bridges, however,
have now had their day, and in recent years have, in all important cases,
under the enterprising supervision of Mr. G. C. McDonald, the
Company&rsquo;s engineer and locomotive superintendent, been replaced with
iron girders, to the undisguised regret of some old-fashioned believers in
the efficacy of British oak!</p>
<p>This section of the line, indeed, flanked not only by the rivers liable
to flood, but curving its way up steep gradients, over high embankments and
through deep cuttings, is necessarily more subject to mishaps than a level
road, and it is hardly astonishing that it has been the scene of more than
one awkward circumstance.&nbsp; Among them is the story, still told more or
less <i>sotto voce</i>, of how, close to this spot, the driver of an
express goods train, long ago, might have killed the then Chairman of the
Company!&nbsp; The night was wet, and the driver, accustomed to a straight
run down the bank to Moat Lane, was astonished to find the signals against
him at Carno.&nbsp; He applied the brakes, but it was no easy matter
suddenly to curb the speed of a heavy train, and he floundered on, right
into a &ldquo;special&rdquo; toiling up the hill bearing Earl Vane home to
Machynlleth. <a name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118"
class="citation">[118]</a>&nbsp; Happily for everyone concerned, no great
damage was done; Board of Trade officials were less inquisitive in those
days, and it seems to have been easier then than it is now to &ldquo;keep
things out of the newspapers&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Less easy to hide was the huge landslide, many years later, of a portion
of Talerddig cutting, though on this occasion no <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>accident resulted to
any train, and the worst fate that befel the passengers was that, during
the considerable time occupied in clearing the line&mdash;it was at the
height of the tourist season, too&mdash;they and their baggage had to be
conveyed by road for a mile or two, an arduous task accomplished by the
Company&rsquo;s officials without a single mishap.</p>
<p>Such happenings in such a character of country are practically
inevitable, but it was not until the Cambrian had been in existence, as a
combined organisation, for nearly twenty years, that its story was
interrupted, through such a cause, by what was truly described as
&ldquo;the most alarming accident which had ever occurred on the
system.&rdquo;&nbsp; In point of death-roll it was not more melancholy than
that at Caersws, but its scene and its dramatic nature provided a new
feature which intimately touched the public imagination.&nbsp; For it was
the first serious disaster in the annals of these undertakings to a
passenger train, and, though not one of them was even injured, the
hair-breadth escape of several was thrilling enough.</p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1883, the evening train from Machynlleth for
the coast line, drawn by the &ldquo;Pegasus,&rdquo; driven by William
Davies, whose fireman bore a similar name, on reaching the Barmouth end of
the Friog decline, built on the shelf of the rock overlooking the sea,
struck a mass of several tons of soil, which had suddenly fallen from the
steep embankment, together with a portion of retaining wall.&nbsp; The
engine and tender appear to have passed the obstruction and then were
hurled to the rocks below.&nbsp; Most fortunately the couplings between the
tender and the coaches broke, and though the first carriage overturned, and
lay perilously poised over the ledge, it did not fall.&nbsp; The next coach
also overturned, but in safer position, and probably held up the first.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>The remaining coach, which contained most of the passengers, and
the van remained on the rails.&nbsp; Amongst those in the train was Captain
Pryce, once more fortunate in his deliverance from death, and he and others
immediately did what was possible to release the rest from danger.&nbsp; In
the overhanging carriage was one old lady, Mrs. Lloyd, of Welshpool, a
well-known character at Towyn, where she carried on a successful business
in merchandise, and, save for severe and very natural fright, she was got
out without sustaining further harm.</p>
<p>The news of the accident soon spread abroad, and reached Dolgelley,
where a great Eisteddfod was being held.&nbsp; From this assembly Dr. Hugh
Jones and Dr. Edward Jones, well-known medical men over the countryside,
with others, hurried to the scene.&nbsp; But the driver and fireman were
beyond the range of their skill.&nbsp; With bashed heads they lay, the
former in the tender and latter beside the &ldquo;Pegasus,&rdquo; on the
huge rocks that flank the shore.&nbsp; Searching inquiry was made into the
cause of the accident, and though evidence was forthcoming that the utmost
care was taken to watch that section of the line, and Mr. George Owen, the
engineer, and Mr. Liller, the traffic manager, were able to show that all
the recommendations and regulations of the Board of Trade officials had
been complied with in protecting this awkward cutting, the jury considered
the place unsafe and hoped the Railway Company would &ldquo;do something to
prevent occurrence of a similar accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such occurrences, alas! are not entirely within the compass of human
power to control, but, as a matter of fact, no such &ldquo;similar
accident&rdquo; has during its history ever happened at Friog or anywhere
else on the Cambrian system.&nbsp; It was, indeed, not for more than
fourteen years that serious catastrophe <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>attended the working
of the railway, and then the cause seems to have been as uncontrollable as
ever.&nbsp; Late one Friday evening in June, 1897, a Sunday School
excursion train from Royton in Lancashire, drawn by two engines, was
returning from Barmouth, and, close to Welshampton station, only a few
miles short of quitting the Cambrian at Whitchurch, left the rails,
overturning several coaches and telescoping others.&nbsp; The circumstances
were the more pathetic by reason of the fact that most of the passengers
were children, homeward bound, after a joyous day by the sea.&nbsp; Nine
were killed outright, two died later in hospital, and many others were more
or less seriously injured.&nbsp; Dr. R. de la Poer Beresford of Oswestry,
medical officer to the Cambrian Railway Co., and many other professional
and lay helpers, rendered gallant service, and the railway ambulance corps
were a valuable adjunct in the arduous task of dealing with the great work
of tending the wounded.</p>
<p>There was some little difficulty in ascertaining the exact cause of the
accident, but the Coroner&rsquo;s jury were satisfied that there was
&ldquo;no negligence on the part of any of the officials,&rdquo; and were
of opinion that the disaster would not have happened but for a Lancashire
and Yorkshire four-wheeled brake van in the front of the train, which, it
was stated, had been &ldquo;running rough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Searchers after
portents were quick to recal that in his famous &ldquo;Almanack,&rdquo;
exactly opposite the actual date of the disaster, &ldquo;Old Moore&rdquo;
had stated that he was &ldquo;afraid he must foretell a terrible railway
collision in the middle of June.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not a collision, but
the gift of prophecy received sufficient endorsement to create no small
sensation amongst country folk.</p>
<p>Nor is this part of our story, unfortunately, complete without reference
to an actual head-on collision,&mdash;an occurrence extremely rare in
British railway annals&mdash;of even more appalling <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>result in loss of
life, than Welshampton.&nbsp; Of that day, early in 1921 when, through a
most extraordinary and tragic series of misunderstandings amongst the staff
at Abermule station the slow down train was allowed to proceed towards
Newtown to meet the up express from Aberystwyth, on the curve a mile away,
such vivid memories still linger that little need be recounted here of its
harrowing details.&nbsp; The total death-roll, the largest in Cambrian
records, was 17, and the victims included one of the most esteemed of the
directorate, Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest.&nbsp; Here, at any rate, it was
again that mysterious element, &ldquo;the human factor,&rdquo; rather than
any condition of the works or of the rolling stock used which played its
melancholy part, and of that it is sufficient to say that the most
interesting feature of the protracted official inquiry into the
circumstances was the fact that the men concerned were represented at the
inquest by the Rt. Hon. J. H. Thomas, M.P., as General Secretary of the
National Union of Railwaymen, and his skilful conduct of the case was,
apparently, a notable and important influence in determining the
final&mdash;and reconsidered&mdash;verdict of the coroners jury.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>
<p>But these are sorrowful records from which we gladly turn to the lighter
side of railway annals.&nbsp; As a link between them we may mention one
&ldquo;accident&rdquo; which happily unattended with very serious results
in itself, was the direct cause of a famous, and at the time, a sensational
&ldquo;incident.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1887 the down morning mail train ran off
the line at Ellesmere and it was held that this was due to delay on the
part of the porter in not being at the points in time to work them
properly.&nbsp; For at this time the interlocking system, made compulsory
under the Act of 1889, had not been installed, <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>and the safety of
trains depended on due attention to the pointsman&rsquo;s functions.&nbsp;
When, in 1891, a Committee of the House of Commons, of which Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach was chairman, sat to inquire into the length of railway hours,
the Ellesmere mishap was brought up as an example of what occurred when
railway servants were expected to work for long stretches, though Mr. John
Conacher (who had joined the Company&rsquo;s staff in 1865, become
secretary on the retirement of Mr. George Lewis in 1882, and later had
succeeded to the managership) was able to produce evidence that it was not
so much weariness of the flesh as the fact that the porter was playing
cards with a postman waiting with the mails and a stranded passenger
waiting for the train which led to his late arrival at the points.</p>
<p>The porter was consequently dismissed, whereupon a memorial praying for
his re-instatement was signed, amongst others, by the then Ellesmere
stationmaster, the late Mr. John Hood.&nbsp; This appeared to the
management so undesirable an attitude for a stationmaster to take in the
matter of service discipline that he was temporarily suspended and removed
from Ellesmere,&mdash;a step which, it was publicly explained, had been
contemplated some years before the accident, but not carried out,&mdash;to
Montgomery.&nbsp; Mr. Hood himself gave evidence before the Parliamentary
Committee, alleging that the mishap was due to the rotten condition of the
permanent way, and though this created a good deal of sensation and alarm,
public assurance was promptly restored when it was pointed out that such a
conclusion was entirely rebutted by the report issued by the Board of Trade
Inspector as a result of his personal examination of the line immediately
after the accident.</p>
<p>Probably little, if anything, more might have been heard of the affair,
for the Select Committee had risen for the Parliamentary recess, were it
not that the directors, carrying out a <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>detailed examination
of their own into the circumstances brought to light again by the inquiry,
had laid before them a recommendation by their chief officials on which,
rightly or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, they decided to dispense with Mr.
Hood&rsquo;s services altogether.&nbsp; Mr. Hood was summoned to Crewe,
where he had an interview with the Chairman of the Company, Mr. J. F.
Buckley, who was accompanied by two of his colleagues on the
Board,&mdash;Mr. Bailey-Hawkins and Mr. J. W. Maclure, M.P., and Mr.
Conacher, the manager, but to a memorial in favour of the
stationmaster&rsquo;s reinstatement, they declined to accede.</p>
<p>The fat was now in the fire, and a very fierce blaze ensued.&nbsp; It
lit up the industrial world, then struggling into organic solidarity, with
lurid flames, and there were those who had some trading or personal
grievance against the company, who not less eagerly threw on fresh fuel of
their own.&nbsp; Protest meetings were held at Wrexham and Newtown, at
which resolutions were carried condemnatory of &ldquo;excessive
hours,&rdquo; and the late Mr. A. C. Humphreys-Owen, of Glansevern, though
he had not been present at the Crewe conclave, was, as a director of the
Company and a prospective Parliamentary candidate for the Denbigh Boroughs,
singled out for special attack, and as warmly defended by some of his
friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Harford, general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Railway
Servants of the United Kingdom, with what was, perhaps, an unconscious gift
of prophecy, declared that &ldquo;little railways were a gigantic mistake,
and the sooner the better they are taken over by some larger concern, for
the workmen and the shareholders.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Labour Press echoed with
resounding phrases about &ldquo;Cambrian tyranny,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;victimisation,&rdquo; and Mr. Hood was acclaimed a martyr of
overbearing officialism.</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>More serious was the attitude and the action of Parliament.&nbsp;
The House of Commons, ever quick to resent any appearance of tampering with
its &ldquo;privileges,&rdquo; were sensitive to the suggestion of what
seemed to them some interference with a witness before their Select
Committee, and not long after the new Session opened, in 1892, Mr.
Conacher, who had, meanwhile, left the Cambrian, to the regret of the Board
and many others, to assume the larger responsibility of management of the
North British Railway Co., was summoned from Edinburgh to appear, with Mr.
Buckley and Mr. Bailey-Hawkins, at the Bar of the House to receive the
admonition of Mr. Speaker Peel.&nbsp; Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Maclure,
being a Member of the House, was at the same time required to stand in his
place, where, with bowed head, that burly and genial gentleman, looked very
like a schoolboy listening to the stern rebuke of a formidable
headmaster!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toby M.P.,&rdquo; glancing down from his seat in the Press
Gallery on this rare and impressive scene, has described it in the pages of
&ldquo;Punch&rdquo; in characteristic fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thursday, <i>April</i> 7<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chairman of Cambrian Railways held a special meeting at
Bar.&nbsp; It was attended by Mr. Bailey-Hawkins, and Mr. John Conacher,
Manager of the Company . . . The latter, resolved to sell his life dearly,
brought in his umbrella, which gave him a quite casual
hope-I-don&rsquo;t-intrude appearance as he stood at the Bar.&nbsp;
Members, at first disposed to regard the whole matter as a joke, cheered
Maclure when he came in at a half-trot; laughed when the Bar pulled out,
difficulty arose about making both ends meet . . . Bursts of laughter and
buzz of conversation in all parts of the House; general aspect more like
appearance at theatre <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>on Boxing Night, when audience waits for
curtain to rise on new pantomime.&nbsp; Only the Speaker grave, even
solemn; his voice occasionally rising above the merry din with stern cry of
&lsquo;Order!&nbsp; Order!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hicks-Beach&rsquo;s speech gave new and more serious turn to
affairs.&nbsp; Concluded with Motion declaring Directors guilty of Breach
of Privilege and sentencing them to admonition.&nbsp; But speech itself
clearly made out that Directors were blameless; all the bother lying at
door of Railway Servant who had been dismissed.&nbsp; Speech, in short,
turned its back on Resolution.&nbsp; This riled the Radicals; not to be
soothed even by Mr. G. interposing in favourite character as Grand Old
Pacificator.&nbsp; Storm raged all night; division after division taken;
finally, long past midnight, Directors again brought up to the Bar, the
worn, almost shrivelled, appearance of Conacher&rsquo;s umbrella testifying
to the mental suffering undergone during the seven hours that had passed
since last they stood there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaker, with awful mien and in terrible tones,
&lsquo;admonished&rsquo; them; and so to bed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chief actors in this arresting and peculiar drama have now all past
from the stage, almost the last survivor, Mr. Hood himself, dying in 1920,
after a long career of public service in the local administration of civic
affairs at Ellesmere, and not before, through the gracious good offices of
the last General Manager, Mr. Samuel Williamson, full and formal
reconciliation had taken place between him and the Company.</p>

<p>Rare, indeed, is such an &ldquo;incident&rdquo; in the annals of any
British Railway.&nbsp; Much rarer, at any rate, than another cause for
special managerial anxiety, though not untinged with pride,&mdash;the
conveyance of a Royal passenger.&nbsp; In this respect the Company,
particularly in more recent years, has borne its full share of
responsibility and sustained it <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>with adequate cause for self
satisfaction.&nbsp; Queen Victoria, though she visited North Wales in the
eighties, travelled by another route, and the first Royal train to pass
over any part of the Cambrian system was that which bore King Edward VII.
and Queen Alexandra, when Prince and Princess of Wales, on their visit to
Machynlleth and Aberystwyth, for the former&rsquo;s installation as
Chancellor of the University of Wales in the middle of June, 1896, and on
the same occasion another distinguished traveller along the line from
Wrexham to Aberystwyth was Mr. Gladstone.</p>
<p>Eight years later, in July 1904, the late King and his Consort journeyed
over the Mid-Wales section to Rhayader, to participate in the opening of
the Birmingham Water Works, and thence to Welshpool on their way to
London.&nbsp; On March 16th, 1910, King George, as Prince of Wales, passed
over the Cambrian on his way to Four Crosses, to perform a similar ceremony
in connection with the extension of the Liverpool Waterworks at Lake
Vyrnwy, and the longest of all monarchical tours over the system was when,
in the middle of July, 1911, King George, Queen Mary, and other members of
the Royal family proceeded from Carnarvon via Afonwen and the Coast section
to Machynlleth as guests at Pl&acirc;s Machynlleth, the following day to
Aberystwyth for the foundation stone-laying of the Welsh National Library,
and two days later, from Machynlleth to Whitchurch on their way to
Scotland.</p>
<p>The last Royal journey was a short one, again over the Mid-Wales
section, in July 1920, to enable the King to inaugurate the Welsh National
Memorial institution at Talgarth, on which occasion his Majesty was
graciously pleased to express high appreciation of the facilities ever
afforded by the Board and management whenever he travelled over their
system.&nbsp; And on this gratifying note we may appropriately bring our
record of Cambrian &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; to a close.</p>

<p>And so, by devious routes and with many a halt by the way, we come to
the Cambrian of to-day.&nbsp; In such a chronicle as this demarcations of
time must necessarily appear more or less arbitrary, and if we include
under this heading a period which goes back to 1904, it is merely because
it is from that year the system has, with only some subsequent minor
extensions in mileage, assumed the organic form familiar to us at the
present time.&nbsp; For it was then that the policy of amalgamation,
entered upon forty years earlier with the consolidation of the various
independent companies, was carried forward another important stage, and it
is since that date the most significant developments, both in road and
rolling stock, made necessary by the ever-increasing demands of modern
traffic conditions, have mainly been accomplished.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As far back as February 1888, the question of merging the Mid-Wales
Railway came before the Cambrian directors, under the earnest pressure of
Mr. Benjamin Piercy.&nbsp; It was not long before even wider schemes of
mutual co-operation <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>among the railways of the Principality were
being publicly discussed, under the aegis of what was termed the Welsh
Railway Union, for which facilities were sought, by means of a private
Bill.&nbsp; A deputation, introduced by Sir George Osborne Morgan (as he
afterwards became) and headed by Mr. (later Sir John) Maclure and Sir
Theodore Martin, waited on Sir Michael-Hicks Beach, at the Board of
Trade.&nbsp; Under this scheme all the lesser Welsh railways were to form a
link for through traffic, by way of the projected Dee Bridge and Wrexham to
South Wales; but, though nothing materialised at the time, there was
something of intelligent anticipation about the appointment, in 1891, of
Mr. Conacher, as manager of the Neath and Brecon Railway, one of the
parties to the proposal, in addition to his management of the
Cambrian.&nbsp; Very soon afterwards, however, Mr. Conacher left for the
North British and the joint office was terminated.&nbsp; But another
significant new link in the &ldquo;Welsh Union&rdquo; chain was forged in
1895, with the construction of the Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway, which,
though an independent Company, with the Hon. George T. Kenyon, M.P., as its
first chairman and Mr. O. S. Holt as secretary, was from the outset worked
by the Cambrian, and thus formed a new direct connection from that
Company&rsquo;s system, into the Denbighshire coal-field, and hence, by the
Wrexham, Mold and Connah&rsquo;s Quay, later absorbed by the Great Central,
into Chester and the Merseyside.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, no startling departure, when in 1904, the Cambrian
sought Parliamentary powers, for which Royal Assent was granted on June
24th, to carry out its previous proposal to amalgamate with the Mid-Wales
Railway.&nbsp; This line, some 50 miles in length, which had been
constructed about the same time as the Newtown and Llanidloes Railway, <!--
page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>and
formed a junction with that undertaking at the latter town, had all along
been in friendly co-operation with the Cambrian, but the change of company
also involved a change of carriages at Llanidloes with consequent
delay.&nbsp; From July 1st in that year Cambrian trains began to run
through, down the beautiful valley of the Upper Wye, connecting with the
Midland system at Three Cocks Junction and then from Talyllyn Junction,
over the Brecon and Merthyr Company&rsquo;s metals into Brecon, while on
the financial side, stocks and shares of the Mid-Wales were converted into
stocks and shares of the Cambrian, and the arrears of interest on the
Mid-Wales &ldquo;B&rdquo; debenture stock were capitalised into Cambrian
&ldquo;B&rdquo; debenture stock.</p>
<p>The Mid-Wales like the Cambrian, had had a chequered early career.&nbsp;
Indeed, it might be said that its embarrassments began at the cutting of
the first sod, when Mr. Whalley, who was as ubiquitous as ever where Welsh
railways were concerned, permitted himself to make some remarks, in his
speech, disparaging Messrs. David Davies and Savin because he disapproved
their method of financing the line.&nbsp; Never before or since has such a
scene been witnessed on such an occasion!&nbsp; In vain did some of the
influential company present attempt to smooth things over.&nbsp; Mr.
Whalley was not to be easily downed, and amidst a chorus of &ldquo;hisses,
whistles and pipes&rdquo; he was heard declaring that he was a gentleman, a
member of Parliament and a magistrate, and &ldquo;it was not his place to
argue with men like the contractors.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>But that was long ago, and by 1904 had been almost forgotten.&nbsp; What
was more present in the public mind was the advantage to owners and traders
and travellers alike of the formation of the through route (passing near to
the <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>gigantic Birmingham Waterworks at Rhayader, and attaining the
highest point on the Cambrian system, at Pantydwr, 947 feet above
sea-level), along which, every year, in growing numbers, the Cambrian
trains have carried hosts of excursionists from the teeming valleys of
South Wales to refresh themselves&mdash;and spend money&mdash;in the health
resorts of Cardigan Bay.</p>
<p>In the same year, too, the Tanat Valley Railway, from Oswestry to
Llangynog, to which reference has already been made in a previous chapter,
<a name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131" class="citation">[131]</a>
the first sod having been cut at Porthywaen by the Countess of Powis on
September 12th, 1899, was opened for traffic.&nbsp; Six years later, in
1910, the Mawddwy Railway, running from Cemmes Road to Dinas Mawddwy, which
had formerly belonged to an independent Company and later closed, was
re-opened under the Light Railways Act, and worked by the Cambrian, while
in 1913, power was obtained to carry out yet another amalgamation, which,
small in itself, considerably adds to the amenities of tourist traffic in
the neighbourhood of Aberystwyth.</p>
<p>This was the absorption of the little Vale of Rheidol Light Railway,
which, authorised by Act of August 6th, 1897, had been constructed on a two
feet gauge, with power to enlarge up to 4ft. 8&frac12; inches, from that
resort up the valley for just over a dozen miles to the beauteous gorge
spanned by the far-famed Devil&rsquo;s Bridge.&nbsp; Though an independent
company, its directors were later entirely drawn from the Cambrian Board,
with Mr. Alfred Herbert, of Burway, South Croydon, as chairman.&nbsp; The
line was opened for goods traffic in August 1902 and for passengers the
following December, and since then many thousands of visitors to
Aberystwyth have made <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>the delightful journey which its winding
course along the hillside affords to lovers of charming scenery.&nbsp; By a
subsequent Order, in 1898, an extension of the line was authorised from
Aberystwyth to Aberayron, as a separate undertaking with a separate share
capital, but this was never attempted, and the Order subsequently expired,
in 1904.&nbsp; Under the 1913 amalgamation Scheme the stocks of the Vale of
Rheidol Company were converted into Cambrian stock, and the line worked as
part of that company&rsquo;s system.</p>
<p>Together with the Welshpool and Llanfair line (already described) <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132" class="citation">[132]</a>
which had been opened in 1903, it gave the Cambrian a narrow guage mileage
of twenty-one miles, and a total mileage in operation (including the final
extension into the commodious new station at Pwllheli in July 1909), of
exactly 300 miles, of which twelve only are double line.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>But it is not only in length that the Cambrian has developed in recent
years.&nbsp; The advance in constructional details and rolling stock is by
no means less marked.&nbsp; Following the abolition of second class
compartments, in 1912, has come a steady advance in the comfort and
convenience of the passenger coaching stock, until to-day, when the latest
composite corridor coaches 54 feet long are accepted by other companies for
through running.&nbsp; Some of them are regularly worked on through trains,
to Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London, and, in the tourist
season, to other places in the North of England and South Wales.&nbsp;
Recently a dining and luncheon car service has been inaugurated in the
summer between Paddington and Aberystwyth, and buffet cars are <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>attached to
some of the principal trains between Pwllheli and Aberystwyth and
Shrewsbury and Whitchurch all the year round.</p>
<p>During the time when Mr. Herbert Jones, who succeeded the late Mr. Wm.
Aston, was locomotive superintendent, <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a> a large stride forward was
taken in this department.&nbsp; The engines now employed in hauling these
long and heavily-ladened tourist trains are mighty monsters compared with
what appeared &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; enough to travellers in the fifties
and sixties.&nbsp; Readers turning to the illustrations on another page may
see at a glance the difference between &ldquo;then&rdquo; and
&ldquo;now&rdquo; both in the coaching and the locomotive
departments.&nbsp; Even the contrast between the engines as originally
constructed and as rebuilt is sufficient to impress the interested
traveller, but to these, in late years, have been added a powerful class of
passenger and goods engines, weighing, with the tender, 75 tons, the
passenger class being bogie engines, with four coupled wheels 6ft.
diameter, and the goods being the ordinary six wheel coupled type.</p>
<p>Only one change from the old to the new is, perhaps, regretted by
some.&nbsp; One of the qualifications of what is popularly termed the
&ldquo;railwayac,&rdquo;&mdash;the man who, though not in the railway
service, is keenly interested in the running and working of
trains,&mdash;is that he should be able to recite, on demand, an accurate
catalogue of engine names.&nbsp; In former days, on the Cambrian, as on
some other lines, every engine had its name, and there are still
middle-aged men in this locality who carry from boyhood affectionate memory
of many of these labels,&mdash;the &ldquo;Albion,&rdquo; the <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;Milford,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Mountaineer,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Plasffynnon,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Maglona&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gladys,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Glansevern,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Tubal
Cain,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Prince of Wales&rdquo; and the like, and, later the
&ldquo;Beaconsfield&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hartington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To some of the directors, however, the habit of christening engines,
especially after distinguished persons or the seats of the local gentry,
seemed to savour of flunkeyism and the custom was abandoned.&nbsp; Only on
the London and North Western and the Great Western, and the London Brighton
and South Coast, the writer believes, does it still generally obtain, and
even there it is limited to the larger passenger locomotives.&nbsp; Gone,
too, is the old decoration of the tenders with the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
plumes, and the only ornamentation of engines and coaches finally left
being the Company&rsquo;s crest, the English rose entwined with the Red
Dragon of Wales, the original design for which was made and presented to
the directors many years ago by the late Mr. W. W. E. Wynne, of Peniarth,
Towyn, a noted antiquarian of his day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page134b.jpg">
<img alt="Mr. Samuel Williamson, General Manager, 1911-1922, and Secretary,
1906-1922" src="images/page134s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>With the increased weight of engines and coaches necessarily came a
strengthening of the road.&nbsp; The rebuilding of the old wooden bridges
has already been noted, but some of the girder bridges have been rebuilt
also, the last of these, over the Severn at Kilkewydd, near Welshpool,
having only been completed last year.&nbsp; This is now a fine structure of
four clear spans of more than 60 feet, supported by concrete piers and
abutments.&nbsp; Then, too, for the light iron rails laid on a sandy
ballast of the old days there have been substituted 80 lb. steel rails laid
on broken granite ballast, with a corresponding strengthening of the
fastenings, sleepers, etc., and to expedite the running of non-stop trains,
mainly during the pressure of the tourist season, special appliances have
been erected at wayside stations for the exchange of the <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>&ldquo;tablet,&rdquo;
by means of which the working of a single-line railway is controlled,
additional passing places have been constructed, station platforms in
several cases considerably lengthened, and one or two new stations opened,
bringing the total on the system up to 100.</p>
<p>During the war when Park Hall, Oswestry, was converted first into a vast
training camp and later, in part, into a German Prisoners of War camp, a
large amount of military transport work fell to the Cambrian, a network of
sidings being constructed through the area occupied, and about a quarter of
a million of troops were carried over the system to and fro, an additional
strain on the human and mechanical resources of the Company which, however,
was most efficiently sustained.</p>
<p>Nor does this entirely exhaust the efforts of the Company to serve the
district through which its railways pass, to increase the comfort and
convenience of the travelling public and to augment and proclaim the
amenities of the resorts to which it carries us.&nbsp; To this end, two
enterprises, though not directly under the control of the Cambrian, but
with which they are linked by close co-operative ties, have materially
contributed in recent years.&nbsp; Though Mr. Savin&rsquo;s ambitious
schemes for erecting hotels to house the tourists whom the trains might
bring ended in financial disaster, the idea was an excellent one; and, when
revived, some years ago on a more limited scale and under more propitious
conditions, it successfully matured in the formation of the Aberystwyth
Queen&rsquo;s Hotel Company, of which a prominent Cambrian director, Mr.
Alfred Herbert, is chairman, and some other members of the Board, as well
as the General Manager, Mr. S. Williamson, are directors, with the
Assistant Secretary of the Cambrian, Mr. S. G. Vowles, serving as
Secretary.&nbsp; Not the least advantage of this sort of <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>quasi-partnership is
the facility which it has enabled the Cambrian to offer to the public in
the shape of combined rail and hotel tickets from the principal inland
stations on the system, entitling the visitor to travel to and fro and
enjoy the excellent week-end hospitality of the Queen&rsquo;s for an
inclusive moderate charge.</p>
<p>It may be truly said, however, that no such allurement is required by
those who are already familiar with the charms of Cambria as they unfold
themselves in almost illimitable variety all along this western seaboard,
stretching from the mouth of the Rheidol right up to the lonely fastnesses
of Lleyn.&nbsp; It is, therefore, more particularly to the enlightenment of
the uninitiated that the Cardigan Bay Resorts Association, of which the
Rev. Gwynoro Davies, Barmouth, is chairman and Mr. H. Warwick,
superintendent of the Cambrian line (and now its divisional traffic
superintendent under the Great Western control), secretary, working in
close and sympathetic co-operation, not only with the Cambrian Company, but
with several of the local authorities, has done much, year after year, to
make known to the potential English tourist the delights which await him on
his arrival in these coastal towns.</p>
<p>At any rate the glorious hills and valleys bordering the Bay, which have
inspired more than one Welsh literary itinerant to rhapsody, and furnished
Mr. Lloyd George with many a homely and figurative peroration, have proved
no mean asset to the proprietors of a railway, whose traffic consists so
largely of tourists.&nbsp; To the shareholders of the Cambrian has come the
satisfaction of knowing that a concern, which was born under, and for many
years continued to struggle for its very existence with, the most
embarrassing financial conditions, has gradually acquired a more robust
economic constitution.</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>But it has only been accomplished by long and patient
conservation of its slender reserves.&nbsp; Mr. Conacher, it used to be
said, during his arduous and energetic management, was &ldquo;improving the
Cambrian in the dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his successors has been bequeathed
the advantage of bringing that quiet sowing to a fruitful and more apparent
harvest.&nbsp; Mr. Conacher was succeeded in the secretariat by another
wise and diligent officer, the late Mr. Richard Brayne, whose subsequent
retirement to a quiet life in the seclusion of the Shropshire village of
Kinnerley, was a matter of regret to all who knew and realised his sterling
service to the Company.</p>
<p>On the managerial side of the joint-office which Mr. Conacher vacated,
following the comparatively short but bustling reign of Mr. Alfred Aslett
(during which much was done to redeem the line from an unlucky reputation
for unpunctuality that had become locally proverbial), and that of the late
Mr. C. S. Denniss, the Company were fortunate in securing for this
responsible office, Mr. Samuel Williamson, trained under Mr.
Conacher&rsquo;s tutelage, and thus specially fitted to continue that wise
and far-seeing policy which had marked his instructor&rsquo;s
methods.&nbsp; Under Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s guiding hand, still further
assisted in very valuable fashion by Mr. Conacher, when, for a few years
before his death, in 1911, he was called to the chair of the Board, and
since then by a Board of which Major David Davies, M.P., the grandson of
one of the foremost of the Cambrian&rsquo;s pioneers is chairman, the
financial position of the Company has very materially improved.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the terms of amalgamation with the Great Western
Company.&nbsp; In 1908 the stockholders of the Company received the sum of
&pound;96,556, but such was the rapid improvement in the Company&rsquo;s
position that in 1913 they received &pound;119,005, that is to say, in the
space of <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>five years the amount increased by 23&frac14; per cent., and it
was on this basis that the negotiations with the Great Western Company were
carried through in 1922, because for the period from 4th August, 1914, to
15th August, 1921, under the arrangement with the Government, the profits
of the Company were fixed on the 1913 basis.&nbsp; Commencing as from 1st
January, 1922, the terms of amalgamation give to the proprietors of the
Cambrian Company an immediate annual income of &pound;119,307, and this
will be increased as from 1st January, 1929, by a further annual sum of
&pound;18,161, assuming the dividend on the Ordinary Stock of the Great
Western Company remains as at present, viz:&mdash;7&frac14;% per annum,
thus making a total of &pound;137,468.&nbsp; In addition to this
improvement, the Company, on the one hand, during the period from 1909 to
1913, cleared off a heavy debt, and, on the other hand, built up very
substantial reserves and, in fact, at the end of 1913, the financial
position of the Company was stronger than it had ever been.</p>

/>
</a></p>
<p>It has, however, been an agency beyond the control of directorate or
internal management which has shaped the final destiny of the
Company.&nbsp; From time to time during the years up to 1914 rumours have
circulated concerning the prospective purchase of the Cambrian by one of
its great neighbours, either the Great Western, or, more often, the London
and North Western, with which it had long maintained a close working
alliance.&nbsp; But nothing ever matured in this direction.&nbsp; Cynics
were apt to suggest that the explanation might be sought in the parable of
the two dogs and the bone, neither of them really wanting it, but each
anxious that the other should not get it.&nbsp; Anyhow, it seemed as if the
Cambrian would become permanently established as the largest of the
independent Welsh Railways, when the <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Great War plunged,
not only this country, but more than half the civilized world into economic
chaos.&nbsp; Emerging from its war-time experience of State-control, the
Cambrian, like other railways, found itself faced with a hugely-augmented
labour bill, to meet which out of potential future revenue, appeared
practically impossible.</p>
<p>It was under these embarrassing circumstances that Sir Eric Geddes, as
Minister of Transport, devised his grouping scheme, by which all English,
Welsh and Scottish railways are amalgamated in groups as a means to more
economical working.&nbsp; Together with all the other independent Welsh
Companies, the Cambrian was placed in the Western Group, with the Great
Western as absorber, and, the proposal meeting with the approval of the
proprietors, to whom the transfer offered, on the whole, a decided
financial advantage, while the directors were consoled for loss of office
with a grant of &pound;7,000, it was merely left for the Amalgamation
Tribunal to give its final assent.&nbsp; This was done early in March and
on Lady Day, 1922, almost exactly seventy years after its original
inception, the Company, as a separate and independent organisation,
officially ceased to be.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>Such is the story of the Cambrian.&nbsp; If the reasonable limitations
imposed on the prolixity of authorship compel its reduction, in these
pages, into more or less broad outline, it is not for lack of plentiful
material available to the more meticulous student of its details, out of
which, it would be easy to weave a hundred volumes.&nbsp; Lying in the
lumber cupboards of solicitors&rsquo; offices up and down Montgomeryshire,
in the strong rooms of Welsh border banks, or amongst the <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>family
archives of some of the great country seats of Powysland, there are to be
discovered by the diligent searcher masses of old papers, the very
existence of which may, perhaps, have been half-forgotten by their present
owners, but which waft us back more than half-a-century, and shed varied
light on some of the obscurer passages in Welsh railway annals.</p>
<p>Early prospectuses, full of glowing promises of rich dividends the hopes
of which have long since become as faded as the now yellow leaves on which
they were inscribed.&nbsp; Great tomes of carefully-written-out verbatim
notes of Parliamentary Committee evidence.&nbsp; Equally voluminous records
of judgments delivered in Chancery by illustrious law-givers long since
dead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minutes of Orders on Petition,&rdquo; declaring this,
that and the other about the safeguarding of certain interests, and the
payment of certain dividends&mdash;if any funds could be found for the
purpose!&mdash;and enquiring all sorts of things about &ldquo;gross
receipts&rdquo; and &ldquo;monies actually paid into Court, or which shall
hereafter be paid into court.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, eternal optimism of those
early pioneers!&nbsp; Letters from engineers and contractors.&nbsp; Minutes
of Board Meetings.&nbsp; Books of accounts of &ldquo;preliminary
expenses,&rdquo; in which &ldquo;visits to London&rdquo; seem to bulk so
largely and to exhaust so considerable a proportion of the capital
subscribed by eager shareholders who believed that some fine day they were
to wake to find themselves part owners of a wonderful trunk route yielding
illimitable toll upon the wealth of Lancashire and mercantile fleets of the
far-reaching seas.&nbsp; They are all there in quaint and often incongruous
companionship, and as one turns over their dusty pages and reverently
replaces them in their grave of tattered brown paper, one is prompted to
reflect, not without a wistful sigh, upon the vanity of human hopes and
expectations.</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>And yet, if the Cambrian never became the great and glorious
institution which those pioneers and projectors of its initial component
parts intended, and sincerely believed it would, can it be either truly or
generously said that their labours were in vain?&nbsp; By their courage and
determination and resolute struggle against enormous adversity, they did,
at least, bring into being a public service which has opened up remote
valleys, formed a link between the great centres of England and of South
Wales, and the coast of Cardigan Bay, and kindled a new life for and
offered the opportunity of increased prosperity to many a small country
town in Shropshire, Montgomeryshire, and Merioneth.&nbsp; They have created
means of employment for thousands of workers, and afforded facilities for
recreation for millions more who have thus been enabled and encouraged to
spend their holidays amidst the health-giving breezes of the mountains and
the sea.&nbsp; And above all they, and their successors in the conduct of
the undertaking, with its developing lines, have shown us how, despite the
early apathy and even jealousy of neighbouring &ldquo;giant
leviathans,&rdquo; a small independent railway company can faithfully serve
its day and generation, until, by one of those unforeseen strokes of irony
to which corporate as well as individual life is ever subject, it is thrown
by eccentric Fate into the arms of the very Company, under whose protective
&aelig;gis the originators of the Oswestry and Newtown and the Newtown and
Machynlleth Railways so ardently, but vainly, desired to place themselves
more than half a century ago.</p>
<p>What may be the outcome of this great change it is yet too early to
predict; but, whatever it be, for weal or woe, it is a sad thought to many
that what they have so long known, and smiled at, and cursed, and loved as
&ldquo;the poor old Cambrian,&rdquo; officially is no more, and &ldquo;the
debt that cancels all others&rdquo; is finally discharged.</p>

Davies&rsquo;s career appeared from the pen of an old friend in the
&ldquo;Barry Dock News&rdquo; at the time of the opening of the Barry Docks
in July 1889 and was reprinted in summarised form in his obituary notice in
&ldquo;Bye Gones,&rdquo; July 1890.&nbsp; Besides his connection with the
Cambrian, it gives details of his many other activities, including his
representation of Cardigan Boroughs in the House of Commons from 1874 to
1885, and on the merging of the boroughs into the county, at that date, for
Cardiganshire till 1886, when he was defeated on becoming an opponent of
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish policy; his services on the Montgomery County
Council, and his magnificent generosity to the Calvinistic Methodist
Churches and in aid of the cause of Welsh higher education, a liberality
which has since been continued in fullest measure by his family.</p>

class="footnote">[8]</a>&nbsp; This phrase of Shirley Brooks&rsquo;s was
probably applied rather to the suspension bridge, which Telford planned to
carry the London and Holyhead road over the Straits, and which was opened
on January 30th, 1826, but it not less accurately describes
Stephenson&rsquo;s famous railway tubular bridge, begun in 1846 and
completed in 1850, at a cost of about &pound;600,000.</p>

died on March 24th, 1888, having been engaged on nearly all the railways
started in North and Central Wales, and later on the Sardinian railways,
where he formed a close intimacy with Garibaldi.&nbsp; He returned to
Marchwiel Hall, near Wrexham, where he laid out one of the finest cricket
grounds in the Kingdom.&nbsp; He was a J. P. for Denbighshire and declined
many invitations to enter Parliament.</p>

possession a silver inkstand, bearing the following

of Montgomery, July, 1855.&rdquo;</p>

according to Mr. F. S. Williams, an authority on the history of railway
construction, on no scientific data, but due to the fact that the old
&ldquo;way leaves,&rdquo; or wooden rails, put down to economise the wear
and tear of colliery trains, were so adapted to admit of the wagons passing
through five feet gateways.</p>

and green, with yellow and red lines, until January, 1909, when, for
economical reasons, following the examples of some other railways, the
Cambrian repainted all their coaches entirely in dark green, with yellow
lines.</p>

saloon on the railway, painted in the family colours, yellow and lilac,
with his coat of arms on every door, and fitted with a water tank on the
roof, but it was found too cumbrous for continued use on the main line, and
was afterwards converted into an ordinary carriage, and still runs, in this
more mundane form, on the Tanat Valley branch.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
